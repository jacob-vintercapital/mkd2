<h1 id="part-iii-our-product">Part III: Our product</h1>
<p>In part I we discussed why indexing is a good approach. Evidence suggests trying to beat the market is unprofitable. Almost all investors are better off buying an index fund.</p>
<p>In part II we argued that blockhains are useful, and that -- based on a historical perspective and the evolution of money -- cryptocurrencies might get adopted and used on a daily basis.
We also provided empirical results on how an investor can increase his risk-adjusted returns by allocating a small percentage of his portfolio to cryptocurrencies. These results are öargeöu thanks to the correlation structure between cryptocurrencies and stocks.</p>
<p>Here in part III we ask: What activities are required in order to passively invest in the crypto market? Firstly, we explain why passive crypto investing is almost impossible in practice. Secondly, we discuss how our product solves these problems. Thirdly, we bring up some additional benefits our product provides. Lastly, we draw some comparisons between us and the competition.</p>
<h2 id="difficult-to-buy">Difficult to buy</h2>
<p>Our team have registered accounts at over 20 exchanges. To register an account and fulfill the KYC requirements, a user must send copies of gas bills, photos of passport and sometimes download a video conferencing app to have a video call with the on-boarding team. Waiting times are long -- often several days. Patience is a virtue, and the registration process is a real test of patience.</p>
<p>Different exchanges have different user interfaces. This can make order placing confusing when the customer is used to a certain interface and suddenly the order book is visualized a different way, or the buy button is on the left instead of on the right. Obviously this slows down the speed at which trades can be executed and increases the risk for human errors.
Different exchanges also have different trading rules on order size, leverage, maker and taker fees etc.
Moreover, the same virtual currency can have different names on different exchanges -- bitcoin can for example have the ticker BTC or XBT.
Differences between exchanges increase the risk for manual errors.</p>
<p>For many investors, registering at a single exchange is insufficient due to: asset coverage, technical reliability, liquidity and pricing. All four reasons are discussed below.</p>
<p>Asset coverage is a problem for an investor who want to trade the top 10 cryptocurrencies because all them might not be listed -- Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges but has not listed the top 10 assets.</p>
<p>Technical reliability and up-time has been a problem for many exchanges, especially during periods when many want to trade or open up new accounts such as during the boom of 2017. During this boom, when many new investors wanted to register to buy and some old investors wanted to sell, even the largest exchanges like Kraken and Binance experienced severe problems. Kraken was down so people who really wanted to trade could not. Binance stopped taking on more customers. For times like these investors who have registered at many exchanges have a much higher probability of being able to execute trades.</p>
<p>Liquidity is the third reason to register at several exchanges. When buying large amounts of crypto or buying small cap cryptocurrencies, the order book might not be deep enough. In these cases it is beneficial to spread out the trade on several exchanges.</p>
<p>Pricing is the last and most obvious reason: sometimes the price on one exchange is more favorable than another.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; todo sid provide source that most people bought 1-3 different ones. i say that in part ii also.</p>
<h2 id="difficult-to-store">Difficult to store</h2>
<p>Traditional financial instruments, like stocks and bonds, are stored at a central securities deposit or custodian such as Euroclear. When buying these assets the investor can enjoy the storage solution his bank provides, giving him piece of mind. Cryptocurrencies, in contrast, are stored by the owner. This is a common source of headache for cryptocurrency investors. Storage is important and complicated.</p>
<p>To quantify the importance of storage is easy because losing the password implies a return of minus 100 percent.
To quantify how complicated it is to store the digital assets safely, consider that USD 670 million worth of cryptocurrencies were lost in the first quarter of 2018 due to bad storage or theft. <sup id="fnref:footer-hack-2018q1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footer-hack-2018q1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
When the previous exchange Mt. Gox was hacked, 850 thousand bitcoins were stolen. Assuming a BTCUSD price of 6000 this hack was worth USD 5.1 billion.</p>
<p>Apart from protecting against thieves, all cryptocurrency users must be protected against themselves. Even though users are heavily incentivized to store their digital wealth with care, stories of lost coins are plentiful. One common way is to forget the password. Another is to throw away the laptop when the coins were not worth that much just to realize a year later they threw away thousands of dollars. <sup id="fnref:footer-lost"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footer-lost" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>History provides a clear conclusion: users are not skilled at storing their own digital wealth.
Safely storing the digital assets is hard partly because the technology is in its infancy. Anyone who has bought and safely stored cryptocurrencies know this.
Further, the human brain is trained to hide physical objects but not digital information. This fact about our human nature make digital security unintuitive.</p>
<p>The storage complications provide a good reason for investors to stay away from the crypto market. Institutional investors cannot afford to buy an asset when the risk of loosing it so high.
The technical knowledge needed to safely store coins takes time to acquire, and investors with deep pockets have a high opportunity cost.
Portfolio managers that are asked why they have not bought cryptocurrencies often state volatility as a primary reason, but storage is in fact a much larger problem (especially since higher volatility is accompanied with higher returns).</p>

<!-- ((Most people have bought only 1-3 different virtual currencies, in stark contrast to the case with stocks. A reason for this the the difficulty of buying and storing virtual currencies.)) -->

<p>Assume an investor, whom we can call David, is both bullish on the crypto market and believe in a passive investment strategy. What does he have to follow this strategy?</p>
<p>David must begin by choosing a suitable index to follow. At its core, an index is a set of rules. Let us decide on an index that contains the 10 largest virtual currencies, weighted by their market capitalization. The index is rebalanced monthly to keep up to date with changes in the market.</p>
<p>On the first day, David must take his USD and buy 10 different coins. He wants to safely store the assets himself, so after the purchase he must move the coins from the exchange to his personal wallets. This act is called moving to cold storage.
Setting up a safe storage solution for a single coin is difficult, as described above. Storing 10 different coins increases the difficulty tenfold, because every coin has its own wallet, so storing a basket of coins requires multiple software applications. Every application has its password and preferences. Naturally, David must spend some time to store all cons in safe places.</p>
<p>Increasing and decreasing the portfolio's asset under management are two important activities. David might want to save a fixed amount every month. Or he might want to let cryptocurrencies have around 5% weight in his total portfolio which otherwise consist of an equity index. If so, he needs to buy more coins when the value of crypto decreases and sell them when the value of crypto increases (relative to the equity index) in order to keep his 5% weight intact. Regardless of the reason why David wants to increase or decrease the asset under management in his cryptocurrency portfolio, he must repeat the tiresome process of buying at several exchanges and safely storing into separate wallets. This is difficult and can take hours even for an experienced user.</p>
<p>A month after his first purchase, David should rebalance his cryptocurrency portfolio. In fact, he should rebalance it every month.
Monthly rebalancing is needed because he wants to own the current market, not the market how it looked a when he made his first purchase. For a passive investor rebalancing is necessary and most equity index funds do this automatically (every quarter or so) without any action needed from the investor. In the world of cryptocurrencies, however, rebalancing is a tough manual task.</p>
<p>Rebalancing starts with David transfering the coins from his wallet to the exchange. With several windows open on his computer screens, he will then proceed with executing the trades needed to rebalance his portfolio. As a final step, he sends the coins to cold storage. This is simple in theory but hard in practice with many manual steps.
As a simplified example, consider how the rebalancing process would look if the only event that occurred during a month was that the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency ZEC went from place 11 to 10, while the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency ADA went from place 10 to 11. David must first move his coins from the ADA wallet to an exchange that contain both ADA and ZEC. His choice of which exchange to use will vary depending on a combination of factors: prices for ADA and ZEC, the order books for ADA and ZEC, and how familiar David is with an exchange's interface. When ADA is at the exchange, he can proceed by selling ADA for US dollars, and then buy ZEC with these dollars. Lastly, he will send  ZEC to cold storage. If this was the first time ZEC entered the top 10 index, David would most likely not know a lot about this coin or how its wallet software works in practice. In order to be competent enough and not make a mistake that might cause him to loose the coins, he would have to spend hours reading about ZEC and trying out software.</p>
<p>Th process described above is a mess! The technical barrier is too high. This is a real hinder for investors. Even though it is a simplified example, there are many steps which require research, experience and computer skills. Mistakes are fatal as they can cause the digital wealth to be erased.
We believe there is a better way forward, and that is why we created the Blockchain10 index.</p>
<h2 id="product-an-index-and-a-certificate-or-our-product">Product: an index and a certificate    or Our product</h2>
<p>We have created the Blockchain10 index. It is a diversified index that tracks the cryptocurrency market returns in a similar way that the SP500 tracks the American stock market returns.
The index consist of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, weighted by market capitalization. These 10 cover more than 80% of the total market capitalization. The index is rebalanced monthly.</p>
<p>We will issue an exchange traded note that follows our index. It will be traded on regulated exchanges to provide retail and institutional investors a diversified exposure to the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<!-- above is almost the same text as in 0intro.md -->

<p>Our product is simple, secure, and diverse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple</strong>: investors can buy it at their existing broker like Nordnet. There is no need to register at crypto exchanges and get familiar with their trading interface. More importantly, the investor does not have to send money to the crypto exchange -- a new company that she might not feel too comfortable with.</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>: investors can get custody of their digital assets. Considering the expertise needed to safely store cryptocurrencies most investors will be able to sleep better with custody service from a professional institution.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse</strong>: investors can get exposure to the entire cryptocurrency market and not just individual assets. Investing in a basket of cryptocurrencies is suitable for an investor whom is unsure of which cryptocurrencies will emerge as winners but has a positive outlook on the underlying technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to being simple, secure and diverse, the certificate enjoy a low taxation rate and the index is compliant with the new EU benchmarks regulation. Taxation and compliance is described in the two sections that follow.</p>
<!--
if we need to have one section per benefit then we can do sub-headings with a lot of text.

<h2 id="taxed-lower-or-lower-taxes-or-taxation">Taxed lower or Lower taxes  or Taxation</h2>
<p>According to the Swedish Tax Authority (Skatteverket) it is required to contribute capital gains tax on every single cryptocurrency trade.<sup id="fnref:skatteverket-source"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:skatteverket-source" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> It does not matter if the seller of a cryptocurrency recieve another cryptocurrency or a fiat currency like U.S. dollars, as both crypto-to-fiat and crypto-to-crypto trades are taxable events.
This rule alone makes it impossible to for an individual investor to follow a monthly rebalanced top 10 index himself, as there will be hundreds of taxable events to keep track of. In addition to being time-consuming, the tax rules make crypto trading very costly, since the capital gains tax is 30%.</p>
<p>There is, however, one exception to the tax rule. Companies that are specialized in buying and selling cryptocurrencies are not taxed on every single trade. Thanks to this exemption, firms like Vinter Capital will not be taxed on every single trade. This rule is extremely beneficial to us and our customers. Even if an individual investor could follow a passive strategy himself, our certificate would still be more attractive due to taxation.</p>
<p>In Sweden, an owner of the Blockchain10 certificate can choose to place the certificate in either (a) an account in which the capital gains tax is taken out when they sell the certificate, or (b) an account called "Investeringssparkonto" (ISK) in which they pay a fixed percentage on the assets under management (AUM) and currently that fixed percentage is less than 0.5%. Mathematically, the tax for these two choices are (a) <code>AUM * return * 30%</code>, <sup id="fnref:assumtion-ret"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:assumtion-ret" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> or (b) <code>AUM * 1.49% * 30%</code>.<sup id="fnref:isk-percent"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:isk-percent" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> For returns above 1.49% the latter alternative results in a lower tax, and both alternatives are much better than a 30% capital gains tax on every single trade. Hence, the tax rules makes the Blockchain10 certificate attractive to many investors.</p>
<h2 id="compliantcompliace-with-eu-benchmarks-regulation-or-compliance">Compliant/Compliace ((with EU benchmarks regulation)) or Compliance</h2>
<p>Today, many asset managers (e.g. banks) act as both index provider and asset manager. With the introduction of the EU benchmarks regulation, however, the two entities must be separated. Several banks have reacted by selling their index business to other entites, for example Barcalys sale to X and bankB sale to Y. The separation between index provider and asset manager is important, as it reduces conflict of interest between the asset manager and its customers.</p>
<p>Asset managers are obliged to use benchmarks from those index providers that are compliant. It is the asset manager's obligation to ensure the benchmarks and indices they utilize come from a registered benchmark administrator.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the regulation forces an asset manager to break the contracts it currently has with its customers. To be comliant, these contracts should be terminated. Upon termination the existing financial product vanishes. As a consequence, the asset manager will have to find a new index to build new financial products upon, and then sell this new instrument to their customers.</p>
<p>The regulation is fully applicable as of January 2018, and benchmarks created before 2016 must be compliant in January 2020. Non-compliant asset managers stand to lose significant asset under management and upset their customers. In order to be compliant, asset managers will have to strike deals with index providers.</p>
<p>These four factors -- separation, obligation, contract termination and urgency -- all arise from the new benchmarks regulation. It will increase demand for index providers. All index providers will be an integral part of the asset managers financial products.
Vinter Capital want to become the Europe's first regulated index provider of cryptocurrency indices. We will create indices for single cryptocurrencies as well as a market index suited for the passive investor. When the indices are launched, there should be plenty of asset managers with a lot of asset under management willing to talk with us.
Even single asset trackers, like XBT Provider's bitcoin certificate, need an index since the BTC price is calculated as the average BTC price on three selected exchanges. It is a very simple index, still, the asset manager will need a seperate entity providing the index values.</p>
<h2 id="blockchain10-effects-on-the-market">Blockchain10 effects on the market</h2>
<p>Besides benefitting our customers, the products we create can have an impact on the market as a whole.
We predict our product will increase the amount of capital invested to cryptocurrencies, and so will the trading volume on traditional exchanges.</p>
<!-- one paragraph per benefit. use bold in the first sentence or part of it. -->

<p>Earlier we described the difficulty in buying and safely storing digital assets. These technological barriers exclude many investors from participating in the crypto market. Our exchange traded product lowers the barriers to trade, which allows for more investors and thereby more capital to enter the market.</p>
<p>Besides increasing the amount of invested capital, we predict our products will increase the trading volume on traditional exchanges. This provides an incentive for NASDAQ and its competitors to list our certificate.
The buyers of the Blockchain10 certificate can be split into two separate groups: those who already own cryptocurrencies and those who currently do not. We can call them "new" and "old" investors.
New investors will contribute to an <strong>increase</strong> in the total crypto trading volume when they enter the market.
Old investors will contribute to <strong>shifting</strong> trading volume from crypto exchanges to traditional exchanges, for example from Coinbase to NASDAQ.
These distrinct groups -- the new and old investors -- are interested in the Blockchain10 certificate for different reasons. New investors are currently sidelined due to the technical difficulties in buying the digital assets. Old investors, on the other hand, benefit from the automatic rebalancing and lower taxes.
Nonetheless, from the point of view from the traditional financial exchanges both these groups bring in new revenue to the exchanges.</p>
<h2 id="competition">Competition</h2>
<p><strong>Coinbase</strong> is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges.
Thanks to beautiful design and a user friendly interface their product is a simple point of entry for new investors.
They are frequently in dialiogue with U.S. regulators and Coinbase have emphasized how important compliance is to them. They have also expressed positive views on the regulation of cryptocurrencies.
Coinbase is using its size to expand into new areas that might be profitable in the future. One such area is custody.</p>
<p>Coinbase is not operating in Europe since they focus on being a U.S. complaint crypto exchange. We deem it unlikely that they will expand into Europe, and even more unlikely they will offer a market index fund. If they were to launch an index fund it is more probable the fund would contain only the cryptocurrencies they have listed on their exchange, making the product more of a Coinbase index rather than a market index.
Given this, Coinbase is probably not a direct competitor to Vinter Capital, but rather a competitor to the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and other traditional exchanges.</p>
<p><strong>XBT Provider</strong> issues exchange traded notes tracking the price of BTC and ETH.
Total asset under management is USD 700 million, as of September 2018.
XBT Provider launched their first bitcoin tracker in Sweden during 2015. In 2017 they issued an exchange traded note (ETN) tracking the price of ether. The BTC and ETH certificates are denominated in both SEK and EUR, giving rise to four certificates, and the BTC tracker denominated in SEK is the most popular one.
Their parent company is CoinShares. Based in London they have already added new areas of business such as a crypto hedge fund. [todo sid more?]</p>
<p>XBT provider plans to issue more certificates tracking individual cryptocurrencies like XRP, LTC, todo add all. They also plan to release an exchange traded note containing a basket of five cryptocurrencies. It will be weighted by market capitalization. The index members will be decided on before issuing the ETN.</p>
<!--
+ contacts with inst. investors
+ contacts with exchanges and have prio status there
- fined by nasdaq. etn was taken off the market for 10 days due to marketing material not reflecting it was an ETN.
* Plans on releasing an a basket of their ETNs. it differs a lot from our index fund on several points. for example, the BlockchainX index is designed to be an index that a passive investor can buy into in order to follow the market, wheras xbt's index is merely a collection of all the ETNs htat xbt have issued. a major draw back of their approach is that if four coins enter the index on a rebalancing date, they must issue four new ETNs before they can let their basket include these new coins.
* Instead of investing in a passive index instrument following the market, your betting your money on that XBT Provider adds the right coins at the right time, this expose the investor to follow XBT choice instead of the market opinion.
-->

<p><strong>Grayscale</strong> has a few private cryptocurrency funds for U.S. accredited investors.
Grayscale have 8 different funds that tracks the price of a single cryptocurrency: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, ETC, ZEC and ZEN. The bitcoin fund was started in Sep 2013 and all the other funds in 2017 and 2018.
At the year end of 2018 Grayscale's assets under management was USD 825 million. With their current fees this implies yearly reveneus of approximately USD 17 million.<sup id="fnref:aum-source"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:aum-source" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the funds tracking single assets, Grayscale have launched the "Digital Large Cap Fund", a market capitalization weighted fund containing five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH and LTC. It was launched in Feb 2018 with a yearly fee of 3%.</p>
<p>The major difference between our Blockchain10 index and Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund and XBT provider's planned basket, is that the Blockchain10 index is truly passive and responds to changes in the market. Our index contituents change as the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies change. In January 2019 the fifth largest cryptocurrency was EOS, nevertheless Grayscale's large cap fund keeps holding on to the same assets as before, because the constituents are fixed. Blockchain10 is flexible and reflects whatever the market values the most.</p>
<p><strong>Bitwise</strong> has a private cryptocurrency index fund called BITX.
Founded 2017 in San Francisco, the fund has assets under management of USD 200 million as of September 2018. The fee is 2.5% per annum. It is possible to enter and exit the fund weekly, but exiting within one year of entering costs 3% extra i.e. a soft lockup.
The minimum amount to invest is USD 250,000. If an investor allocates 1% of her portfolio to the BITX fund, her entire portfolio must be worth USD 25 million. This attracts ultra high net worth individuals. Hence Bitwise lowers the technical bar needed to invest, but raises the financial bar. Arguably, most potential investors are still excluded from the market due to the high financial bar. The Bitwise management know this, and they plan to launch an exchange traded fund (ETF) so that their crypto index fund can be bought and sold by anyone with a brokerage account. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected all application for a Bitcoin ETF, due to concerns around liqudity, security, valuation and custody. These reasons holds true for Bitwise's ETF as well.</p>
<p>Bitwise's BITX fund tracks the top 10 cryptocurrencies, weighted by market capitalization. The BITX index is very similar to our BL10 index. A major difference is how circulating supply is calculated. Since market capitalization is given by the price times circulating supply, the choices around how to calculate circulating supply can make a difference on the index value. Bitwise take the current circulating supply and add the supply inflation during the coming five years, before multiplying with price. Vinter Capital, by contrast, simply take the circulating supply times the price. Their formula is <code>Market cap = Price  * (Circulating supply + supply inflation coming 5 years)</code> whereas our formula is <code>Market cap = Price * Circulating supply</code>. What the BITX index assumes is that the coming five years of inflation is known to everyone in the market, and already discounted for in the prices. The negative consequence arising from this choice is that Bitwise's index does not follow the market, so it is not suited for passive investing.
One effect of including the coming 5 years supply inflation is that the cryptocurrency DASH, which has a high inflation rate, is included in Bitwise's index even though DASH is outside the top 10.</p>
<!--
* Bitwise have a Offshore Fund now for non us citizens
- we vs bitwise: low entry point cost (100-1000 EUR) this means you easy can balance the buy to your portfolio strategy. so you can do tolerance rebalancing (as bitwise have written about).

<p>Table: Comparison with competitors. Only Vinter Capital provide exposure to a market index trading on exchange.</p>
<p>Table: A boring table comparing static info. might be added to the larger table and it might not. probably only the AUM row.</p>
<p><strong>Vinter Capital</strong>, our firm, is the only company that will provide exposure to a market index trading on exchange. Our Blockchain10 index is designed with the passive investor in mind. The index is tracking the returns of the cryptocurrency  market as a whole.
Moreover, the Blockchain10 certificate will be traded on traditional exchanges, giving investors daily liqudity and a very low minimum investment size.</p>
<p>Being able to buy and sell an asset throughout the day is of great importance for all investors in any market -- hence the famous liquidity premium. It is of particular interest to investors who want to keep their portfolio's allocation to cryptocurrencies at a fixed percentage e.g. 5% as it is impossible to do so without daily liqudity.</p>
<p>The Blockchain10 certificate lowers the financial bar required to invest, something that cannot be said of Bitwise and Grayscale. Their funds are only available to U.S. accredited investors and require large investments most people cannot afford.</p>
<p>The competiton can be summarized as follows.
Coinbase is a fiat to crypto exchange, with some additional business legs including custody.
Grayscale has several private funds for U.S. accredited investors, and most of their AUM in placed in the bitcoin fund.
Bitwise has a private index fund available only for the few who can afford a USD 25,000 investment.
XBT Provider is an issuer of exchange traded notes on single cryptocurrencies.
Neither Grayscale nor Bitwise offer daily liquidity since their funds are private. The exchange traded notes by XBT provider can be bought and sold intra-day, but they only provide exposure to single assets. Vinter Capital brings the best of both worlds: exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies with public liquidity.</p>
<p>To most of our competitors indexing is merely an experimental part -- a secondary business leg. This fact has negative consequences for the quality of their index: Grayscale's index include a five fixed coins, and XBT is planning to create an index containing five fixed coins based on what exchange traded notes they have already issued. This makes the basket ill-suited for passive investing. The competition is engineering their secondary leg to fit into their existing primary business. Our product, by contrast, is engineered to be the perfect solution for tracking the market returns. This focus allow us to make better design choices that inevitably leads to a more suitable index.</p>
<p>With that said, there are major similarities between Vinter Capital and its competitors.
In essence, we all provide a layer between the underlying cryptocurrencies and the investor. This layer simplifies the way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.</p>
<!--
> The times of a single-coin investment  and narrow choices for buyers of virtual currencies are over. It is evident that investors who reap the benefits of diversification are better off compared to the rest of investor public by capturing the full digital assets’ opportunity set. Different digital assets offer different return patterns and respond differently to swings in Bitcoin price. This provides an opportunity for investors to generate better risk-adjusted returns by holding a basket of the largest digital assets within the proposed ETN. Diversification benefits are common knowledge regarding every asset class in the world. Digital assets are no exception.

> Digital assets exhibit low correlations with SP500 and gold. The main reason why the investments in digital assets are held back today is because of security issues such as handling assets directly as an investor, combined with complicated buying and holding process. The proposed ETN will solve all of these issues, and serve the broad investor community.
