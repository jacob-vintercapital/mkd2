# Product summary

We have created the Blockchain10 index -- a diversified index that tracks the cryptocurrency market, in a similar way that the SP500 tracks the american stock market.

We will issue an exchange traded note that follows our index. It will be traded on regulated exchanges to provide retail and institutional investors a diversified exposure to the cryptocurrency market.

# Document outline

In part I we explain why indexing and passive investing has grown popular the last decade. Furthermore, we explain where diversification comes from and why it improves a portfolio's risk-adjusted returns.

In part II we discuss why cryptocurrencies are valuable and how they can be used. In addition, we illustrate the effect of allocating a small percentage to cryptocurrencies in a traditional portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds.

In part III we bring up some problems with investing in cryptocurrencies and describe how our product solve these problems. We then provide some additional benefits our product brings to individual investors and the market as a whole.
