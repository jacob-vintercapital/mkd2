## Time period used

Unless otherwise specified, the time period we use for graphs and calculations are 2015-11 to 2018-11. The data frequency is always daily, unless otherwise specified.

## Bandwidth portfolio

In the section [Including cryptocurrency to a traditional portfolio] we showed the historical returns for a portoflio with 5% allocation to the Blockchain10 certificate and 95% allocation to a traditional 60/40 stocks/bonds portfolio.
In practice, it is almost impossible to keep exactly 60% allocated to stocks and 40% to bonds in the traditional portfolio TRD. From day to day, price fluctuations alters the relative weights. This is even more true for the balanced portfolio BAL since it contain volatile cryptocurrencies. Whenever the largest cryptocurrencies increase in value so does the portfolio's allocation to BL10, and vice versa.
For this reason it is more realistic to use allocation intervals rather than exact percentages. This allocation strategy is often refered to as "bandwidth" rebalancing since we set an initial weight to for example 60% but then allow the weight to vary between 55% and 65%. Let us carry out a similar analysis as with TRD and BAL, but with their more realistic bandwidth versions TRDB and BALB.
Here, TRDB is a traditional portfolio with initial weights of 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds, and TRDB is rebalanced to its initial weights whenever the weight in stocks go above 65% or below 55%.
Similarly, BALB is a balanced portfolio with initial weight of 95% in TRDB and 5% in BL10, and BALB is rebalanced back to its initial weights whenever weight in BL10 go above 7% or below 3%.
Conclusions from the simpler example with BAL witll holds...


## Chain events and economies of scale

this was move from part ii under the section added benefits. because it takes so much time to explain and does not give a lot back. especially for the index provider leg of our business. in addition, few stakeholders are interested in it - hence appendix is the right place.

todo maybe change the heading to one of these alternatives

* Capitalization on chain events
* Almost free coins
* Corporate actions and economies of scale
* Events and economies of scale
* Almost free coins and economies of scale

todo sid you can edit this text if you have participated in some air drops.

Sometimes there are actions a coin owner can take that will almost surely be profitable. Examples of such events are air-drops, staking and hard forks. We can call them **chain events** and they share some characterics with events that occur for traditional stocks.

| Chain event |  Stock event |
| ------------| ---------------------|
| Air-drops |  Dividends             |
| Staking   |  Stock lending    |
| Hard fork |  De-merger             |

Table: Chain events resemble stock event.

[Comment]: # "The slides will simply be this table"

**Air-drops** resembles stock dividends.
No company needs to pay out dividends, but some choose to - for a variety of reasons. Likewise, no cryptocurrency project needs to air drop, but some chose to. In an air-drop, every holder of that currency recieves some amount of coins "for free". Many cryptocurrencies are led teams who want to market their project and increase the price of their cryptocurrency. To attract buyers, or reward the current owners of their currency, a project might initiate an air-drop. In order to get the "free" coins, actions are required from the coin holder. An example of such an action can be transferring his coins to a wallet before a due date. Thus, air-drops are not free coins, but rather an event in which investors can trade their time for some reward. Whether that trade is worthwhile depends on a combination of factors such as the investors tehcincal skills, how much he has invested as well as how much coins is payed out in the air-drop. A key difference between air-drops and stock dividends are that dividens are payed out automatically without the stock owner having to take much action, whereas a coin holder must follow the news to know that an air-drop is taking place and then take the required actions to capitalize on it.

**Staking** resembles stock lending.
When staking a coin, the owner puts an amount of the cryptocurrency in a certain place (e.g. a wallet) for which he earns some reward (e.g. a 1% interest on the coins in that wallet).
Only some cryptocurrencies allow staking. The Ethereum community is considering adding a way to stake ETH.[^eth-stake] Some coins that do support staking are EOS, Stellar, Cardano, and DASH. In order to stake DASH, the user must own send coins to a wallet that locks them up for a year, and the minimum amount to send is 1000 coins  - which is currenthly worth USD 200k. The reward for staking DASH is [todo sid insert].
All coins have different ways of staking - the way to stake DASH differs from Cardano - so to stake multiple coins a user must be knowledable and up to date.
The interest earned on staking cannot be considered free money since it requires work and involves some risk of loosing the coins. Staking is a worthwshile acticity if the reward is attractive enough relative to the risk, and only a minority of users stake their coins.[^minority]
A difference between stock lending and staking is the purpose for doing it. Stock lending is primarly done to short sell. Staking, on the other hand, can be done for different reasons e.g. DASH stakers can gain political power and secure the network (in a way similar to bitcoin miners).

[^eth-stake]: todo sid insert source.
[^minority]: todo sid insert source that it is less than 50% of users.

**Hard forks** resembles  company de-mergers.
When a firm de-mergers, it becomes two separate companies. A famous de-merger is when British Telecom spun off its mobile phone business "BT Wireless". Likewise, when a blockchain hard forks, it splits into two separate chains.
The most famous one is when Bitcoin forked from BTC to BTC and BCH. Another famous example is when Ethereum forked into ETC and ETH, because the community had different opinions of whether the Dao hack should be reversed or not (the ETH chain wanted it reversed but the ETC chain did not).
When a company de-mergers, the two individual stocks will have different prices and they will sum to either more or less than when they were one entity - the de merger can be said to either increase or decrease the "shareholder value". The same is true for blockchains. In the case of the Bitcoin hard fork, the total value of both coins after the work was higher than before. Everyone who held Bitcoin before the fork was granted equally many BCH as they had in BTC, so that a user who owned BTC 2.44 before the fork had a total of 2.44 BTC + 2.44 BCH after the fork. Due to how the prices evolved, users were better off before the fork than after - one could say that the fork increased "coin holder value". In future hard forks the prices of the coins after the fork has occured is inknown, so the coin holder value might increase or decrease. Still, in both cases the owner will need to take some actions. After the bitcoin fork happened, every user who wanted to claim their BCH had to perform a series of techincall steps (including importing the BTC private key into a BCH compatible wallet). Even today, many early adopters of bitcoin have not got ahold of their BCH, and since those coins are of monetary value the logical conclusion must be that these users lack the technical skills needed to capitalize on the fork. Many of these users can be considered early adopters - nevertheless they would have had higher returns by investing in a fund that posessed the ability to capitalize on the fork.

In the future there might be other types of chain events that does not exists today. Cryptocurrencies are yet in their infancy, so change is to be expected. All of the mentioned chain events (air-drops, staking and forks) have occured due the communities' choices, and the open source nature of cryptocurrencies makes is likely that new ideas spread and gets implemented. The possible innovation and technolical progress is one reason why virtual currencies is an exciting sphere to be in.

Economies of scale clearly exists in chain events.
Vinter capital will utilize its cryptocurrency experts to capitalize on air-drops, staking and forks whenever it is advantagous to do so. Of course it is not guaranteed that these actions will be profitable, or that our firm will be able to do better than a single individual, but it is likely that a professional actor enjoys several advantages over individual users. Two such advantages are more time and capital: A fund can devote more time to the research, and pool capital from many investors in order to make the tradeoff between risk and reward worthwhile.
((Moreover, Vinter Capital is incentivized to act in the best interest of their customers, since a bad performance might lead to lower asset under management.))

## myths  arguments against cryptocurrencies

### volatile

"it is volatile". yes. here is how volatile it is compared to other asset classes.
<!--- we indirectly say it is another asset class, and we put some numbers on the critique so people can see the vol is not so bad. -->

> On a side note itâ€™s worth to mention that the large part of the vol. is attributed mainly from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies huge price surge, not capturing downside risk.


### bubble

"it might be a bubble". yes we know.

- it is early stage. it is uncertain.
- our downside is capped (a fixed amount of time and money will be spent). but the upside is unlimited (if blockchains revolutionize one industry the ROI will be ridiliously high). [^footnote_about_options]
- that's you should make a small bet early, with small portoflio weights.

[^footnote_about_options]: it might be a bubble that pops (goes to zero). it might be the beginning of a tech that explodes and disrupts finance, insurande, and other industries (goes to infinity).  employees and investors in axlantic hold a call option. so we love this volatility / risk / uncertainty since the value of a call option increases with volatility.       the same idea expressed in a more theoreical way: a call option increases in value when the volatility (uncertainty) is high.     investing time and money in this company can be considered as an option on the cryptocurrency market. all employees and investors in this company all hold an option, and one reason this option is valuable is precisely because of the volatility - uncertainty - of whether this technology a bubble about to burst or if it is a techn that will disrupt.


### illegal activity

[comment]: # "i have one content per paragraph here. 1) educate listener what people refer to 2) say that it is not the technologys fault, it is simply a medium 3) even if you blame the medium, please blame usd cash for all illegal activity and discuss that problem rather than the tiny amounts."

Bitcoin is linked with Silk Road, where the purchase of illegal drugs was possible. This gives Bitcoin a bad reputation that it does not deserve.

Criminals have use and will always use technology when performing illegal activities. The technology they use can be cars, cell phones, cash, bitcoin, etc.
We rarely blaim the US dollar or post offices which both facilitate high volume of illegal trades, e.g. guns bought with cash. ((The same logic should apply to other currencies.))

Researchers estimate todo percent of all bitcoin transactions come from illegal activity, [^source-illegal-btc]
whereas todo percent of all Cash in USD cash transactions come from illegal acticity. [^source-illegal-cash]

[^source-illegal-btc]: todo find this.

[^source-illegal-cash]: todo google and insert a trust worthy source.

### more sections

todo: read https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths and include some of these, such as
- 1
- 2
- 7
- 17
- 33
but try to make it less bitcoin focues and more crypto focues, if possible.

### no intrisic value

above we noted that a blockchain digitize trust, and can be used to replace current intermediaries, so from this use case it has value.

moreover, it also has value because it's a network in which value can be transfered - the internet is a network where information can be sent.

> Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network.

### it does not work today

[comment]: # "i dont know if this section should be part of the presentation."

bitcoin has never been hacked, you can send and recieve transactions instantly world-wide (and they settle in 10 min not T+2). there are problem on how hard it is to use and that only a few take it as means of payment.

progress is being made, but it's not done yet.
and it is ok that it not every little detail is solved yet. this was the case both with cars and electricity. [^antonoop-infrastructure-inversion]

[^antonoop-infrastructure-inversion]:  andreas antonop has a good chapter about infrastructure inversion in his non tech book. at first they say "it is so slow, it cant work, look" because the car tries to work in the current infrastructure of kullersten and horses hit. when you build roads for cars, both the horse and the car can go on that road, however, the car flourishes. that is an example of infrastructure inversion.   another example is using electricity in your home. in the beginning it was only right people and nuts who had it. your house could be burnt down, etc. because the infrastructure was gas pipes... same principle as in the car-horse-example.
