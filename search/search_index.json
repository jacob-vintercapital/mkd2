Indexing and traditional finance A passive investor does not try to beat the market, instead, he invests in vehicles like index funds and ETFs tracking the SP500. An active investor, by contrast, tries to outsmart the market by making active bets such as trying to pick the right stock. These bets make it possible for an active investor to perform better or worse than the market. The last 20 years a strong trend has emerged within the financial markets -- passive investing is on the rise. In 2017 the net inflow from active funds to passive index funds were USD 500 billion, as shown in @fig:netflow. {#fig:netflow width=9cm} There are good reasons for investors to put their money into passive vehicles. Academic empirical studies have shown that trying to beat the market is an unprofitable strategy. For an overview of the literature see for example Fama's paper \"Efficient Capital Markets\" published in the Journal of Finance, 1969. To understand why passive investing beats active, consider the following sequential logical argumentation, written in the form of three statements: Active managers cannot collectively beat the market. Sub-groups of active investors do not beat their index. Top performers do not stay top performers. The first statement is just plain arithmetic and was proved by Sharpe in his article \"The Arithmetic of Active Management\" published in the Financial Analysts Journal, 1991. Some active managers must have returns higher the market, and some must have returns lower than the market. As a collective, they will have a return equal to the market. After including fees, however, the sum of all active investors will be beaten by the market due to trading costs. The second statement is proved by empirical studies. Active managers investing in a certain style (e.g. stocks with low high dividend yield or small cap growth stocks) do not beat their sub-index. This make sense because almost any style can be replicated with an index, and since indexes are less costly than portfolio managers an investor can get the same return for a lower fee. The last line of defence for active investing is that whilst the two previous statements are true, there exists people who can make the right judgement call and beat the market consistently. Data suggests the opposite. Every year, some investors do indeed beat the market, but these investors are different persons from year to year. By ranking the portfolio managers in one period, and then studying how they performed in subsequent periods, it is evident that the top performers do not stay top performers. This is logical, since risk taking can give extreme returns -- sometimes extremely positive and sometimes extremely negative. When Professor A. Damodaran formulated the arguments above he he concluded with the following statement. The performance of active money managers provides the best evidence yet that indexing may be the best strategy for many investors. / A. Damodaran, Professor of Finance at NYU. Diversification Portfolio theory has had a huge impact on finance. Markovitz, who won the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, invented portfolio theory in 1952 with his famous paper \"Portfolio Selection\" published in the Journal of Finance. Portfolio theory changed the lens through which assets are considered. Before Markovitz, investors held a small number of stocks and tended to evaluate their stocks in isolation. Today, almost all investors evaluates their portfolio as a whole before buying or selling assets. To understand why portfolios are attractive investments, we can utilize an \"efficient frontier graph\" in @fig:eff-front Any textbook on portfolio theory contain a version of this graph. In the plot we see a collection of assets with their historical volatility on the x-axis and their expected return on the y-axis. Holding one of these assets will give the investor a certain risk (volatility) for a certain reward (return). {#fig:eff-front-simple width=9cm} Investors want high returns and low volatility, so the upper left corner is an ideal place to be. When comparing assets against each other there is, of course, a trade-off between risk and reward: taking on more risk (by for example selling some T-bills and investing in a startup) does increase the expected return but also leads to higher volatility. The efficient frontier is the set of (volatility, return)-points the investor can get if they buy a portfolio of assets, and it is illustrated with a solid black line in the figure. Every single point on the efficient frontier is a portfolio the investor can have. The efficient frontier is located close to the ideal upper left corner, reflecting the fact that portfolios are more attractive than owning a single asset. The reason for this is diversification. {#fig:cor-stocks width=9cm} Correlation is the driver of diversification. When the assets are correlated less than 1.00 with each other, it is possible to increase the risk-adjusted returns by diversifying. The lower the correlations between the assets, the more this solid line will expand to the upper left corner. In @fig:cor-stocks we see the correlation between 10 important constituents of the SP500. Since the correlation between individual equities is below 1.00 putting them in a basket makes financial sense. Here is an important but subtle point: Even though an asset like gold might have inferior risk-adjusted returns to some stocks, it can be rational for an investor to include gold in his portfolio because doing so improves the portfolio as a whole. Diversification stems from correlation, and if gold has a low correlation with stocks then including it will lead to better risk-adjusted returns for the entire portfolio. Indexing and cryptocurrencies Portfolio theory has not influenced the cryptocurrency market yet. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, and many hundreds are traded on large exchanges. But out of the few people that have bought cryptocurrencies, owning only 1-3 different ones is the norm. Just like different companies operate in distinct sectors, different cryptocurrencies try to solve different problems -- some focus on building a general purpose scripting language and others on integrating their software with the current banking system. Just like stocks, cryptocurrencies have a correlation that makes them suitable to be included in a portfolio. As seen in @fig:cor-t10now, the correlation between cryptocurrencies is around 0.20 which is lower than the correlation between stocks. In this regard, indexing makes even more sense with cryptocurrencies than it does for the stock market. {#fig:cor-t10now width=9cm} One way to understand how diversificaiton can work in practice is to consider the \"performance reversals\" for cryptocurrencies. For a long period Bitcoin outperformed almost all other cryptocurrencies. But during the price drop of Bitcoin in January 2018, three of the top 10 digital assets -- EOS, NEO and Stellar -- realized positive returns. Only twice in 12 months has the most profitable cryptocurrency repeated the feat of having the highest in the following month. 5 These performance reversals clearly demonstrate the benefits of diversification. It also provides a good reason to buy a slice of the market, instead of trying to pick a few assets and hope they will perform. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486 Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work, Eugene F.

Out of the hundres of currencies available, the most viable options are: U.S. dollars, euros, british punds, schweizer franc, japense yen, and maybe -- depending on where you live -- your own home currency. The limited number of reasonable answers out of the many possible choices reveal an important fact about money: some are better than others. Blockchains are useful Blockchain computers are new types of computers where the unique capability is trust between users, developers, and the platform itself. This trust emerges from the mathematical and game-theoretic properties of the system, without depending on the trustworthiness of individual network participants. / Andreessen Horowitz, https://a16zcrypto.com/ Firstly, trading increase our living standards . The trading of goods predates both writing and money. We know this because money had to be invented for trade, and the first writings ever found were debt ledgers. When humans started trading goods with each other they agreed to do so because both parties were better off after the transaction, thus economic value was created. Both theorical and empirical evidence suggests that trade make us wealthier and increase our living standards substantially. Secondly, trust is needed for trade. If two parties want to transact but do not trust each other, it will be hard to execute the trade. When the trust is too low, it will inhibit the trade. Larger transaction values require more trust. For a long distance transaction the seller might worry that the payment will not arrive, at the same time as the buyer is unsure of the item's durability. All forms of uncertanty is the enemy of trust. Thirdly, we use trusted third parties today to facilitate trades . Trust is built slowly over time. To prevent zero knowledge about the counterparty to inhibit a transaction we use trusted third parties like stock brokers and apartment brokers, whom are employed by large corporations with regonizable names and logotypes. Their role is to increase confidence in the transacting parties. ((What these companies consist of is essentially trained people who perform manual checks. These tasks can be automated by computers so that the employee supervise what the computer is doing rather than having to perform the manual work herself.)) Fourthly, a blockchain digitize trust . It does so in part because the data cannot be tampered with, 1 so that if something is in the blockchain it will stay there. Imagine what this does to uncertanty. The effect is huge. Instead of relying on a trusted third party, the transacting parties can rely on the blockchain. An intriguing question is: how much economic value can be unleashed via trading thanks to the increase in trust and efficiency that blockchain technology can bring? Given that (1) trading increase our living standards, (2) trust is needed for trade, (3) we use trusted third parties today to facilitate trades, and (4) a blockchain digitize trust, the invetable conclusion is that blockchains are useful. Internet of value or A global network of value transfers ((The internet have disrupted many industries (e.g. media). Cryptocurrencies can disrupt many industries (e.g. finance).)) What the internet did to transfering information, cryptocurrencies might do to transfering value. This is a bold claim, so let us compare the internet with cryptocurrencies by comparing email with bitcoin. Sending messages via email (bitcoin) was the first real application of the internet (cryptocurrencies). If Alice wants to send an email message (bitcoin payment) to Bob, she must know his public address. For this reason, there were intially only a handful of users and very few emails (payments) sent. Usage was concentrated to people with a lot of technical skills and interest in computers, as the diffuculty of sending messages (payments) were so high. The ease of use increase with time, allowing less techincal people to use it too. Surely it is beneficial and intelectually satisfying to understand the inner working of email (bitcoin) but is is not neccessary in order to use it. For Alice to send an email message (bitcoin payment) to Bob, she must not only know his public address but also her own password (private key). This security feature ensure that only she can send information (value). To send and recieve emails (payments) it does not matter which country Alice or Bob are in -- the reach is global. Moreover, it does not matter if they are human -- the technology works if the protocol is followed. Before email (bitcoin) only be humans could send information (value). The fact that computers can do it introduce the possibility for automation. Before email (bitcoin) there was different networks depending on what type of information you wanted to send (where to send the value). Multiple networks existed, such as fax for documents and telephone for audio (todo include name of banking transfer systems such as SEPA). With the introduction of internet (cryptocurrencies) all these networks were united. << ((todo maybe add a fomo section: a lot of vc money was invested in the early days. (include data point). )) << to get a table, see the file comparison.ods . its current content is pasted below. Internet Cryptocurrency Use case Sending information Sending value First app Email Bitcoin Reach Global Global Usability in the beginning Difficult Difficult Usability after 20 years Easy Do not know yet Before Different networks: Fax, telephone. Different networks: SEPA, todo After One network to send information One network to send value Easy to understand No No Can use w/o understanding it Yes Yes VC money invested A lot A lot Table: Internet and cryptocurrencies share some similiarities. Definition of money Money had to be invented for trade. Before there was money, societies relied on gifts and barter -- both of which severly limits trade. Gifts limits a transaction's value and the counterparties we can trade with, since knowing the person or having a history of successful gift exchanges would be required for valuable trades to take place. Another drawback with gifts are that they rely on humans remembering the quality and amount of the good which was recieved -- a common source of conflicts. Barter limits the liquidity and frequence of trade, because if paying in-kind is the only option then both the buyer and the seller must be willing to buy and sell each other's goods simoultaneuously. This requires a coincidence of wants, which is unlikely. For example, what should the fisherman do when he has caught more than he is able to eat? Perhaps the fisherman need clothes, but if his village relies on barter then he must find a tailor today -- otherwise the extra fish will be worthless. The tailor may not be hungry. In this case the fisherman might be able to trade the fish for nuts, the nuts for beer, and the beer for clothes. Obviously the coincidence of wants introduces liquidity and accounting problems: will there be a path from fish to clothes via trading, and what are the appropriate exchange ratios for all goods? In an economy with 100 goods there are 4950 prices to keep track of. Another drawback with barter is that it is almost impossible for a musician to pay his rent. Money solves these problems. All goods can be priced in terms of only one other good so that there are not thousands of exchange rates to keep track of (money is a unit of account). And the musician can recieve money when he plays the piano at a bar (money is a medium of exchange). He can use this money later to pay his rent (money is a store of value). Money can be defined in terms of its functions as a a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Anything that fulfills these properties can be used as money. A more direct way to define money is to say that it is any item (or verifiable record) that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services as well as repayment of debts. From this definition, whose keyword is \"accepted\", it is clear that money works because we believe in it. Consequently money works only if we believe in it. Properties of money Some things are more money than others. This is obvious from the defintion of money because some items (or some verifiable records) function better than others. Seashells cannot be used as money on a beach, and cows are worse than silver coins. Since money works because (and if) we believe in it, we clearly have some set of properties money should have. For something to function well as money, it should be: Scarce, so its value is upheld over time. Durable, so it can be used multiple times. Portable, so it can be carried around. Divisible, so that small payments can be made. Fungible and uniform (meaning that all units are interchangeable and have the same purchasing power) because otherwise parts of the money will taken out of circulation. Easy to verify but difficult to fake, so that accepting it is easy but fooling others with fake money is difficult. Intrinsic value is not a property of money, rather, the lack thereof. A paper bill is not worth anything in and of itself. The value comes from the fact that humans agree to accept it as means of payment for valuable goods and services. History of money or Evolution of money Throughout history we have used many forms of money: seashells, knifes, cows, alcohol, and large stones formed in the shape of doughnuts. They fall under the category of commodity money. All commodity money is easy to understand, and most of them function reasonably well as a unit of account. Some commodities are more money than others, thanks to their proporties such as weight, appearance, divisibility, and scarcity. Gold and solver coins was introduced in 600 BC, and later on many societies used coins that had been issued by their king. Paper money was used in China during the 11th century due to the physical hurdles with commodity money. Gold and silver merchants gave out reciepts which could redeemed for a certain amount of the commodity. This form of money fall under the category of representative money. The reciepts were in essence IOUs because it was the person who held the reciept who had the right to redeem it. Paper money came to Europe during the 13th century, and by the 18th century gold coins had been replaced by paper money backed by gold. This monetary system is referred to as the gold standard. The paper notes were backed by gold in the sense that they were convertible into a certain amount of gold. Currencies backed by gold are sometimes referred to as hard money because gold is a store of value. In the 20th century almost all countries used the gold standard and made these notes legal tender. After the second world war, most countries pegged their currency to the U.S. dollar. In turn, the dollar was pegged to a certain amount of gold. When Nixon abandoned the gold standard in 1971 USD was no longer backed by anything tangible. Countries responded by de-pegging their currency from the dollar and adopted floating exchange rates. Today we use paper money and take it for granted all firms price their goods in some fiat currency such as USD or EUR, but this has not always been the case throughout history. We invented money because it solves practical problems, and we have used different forms of money switching from less convinient solutions (e.g. large stonges and cows) to more convinient forms of money (e.g. coins, paper and digits on a screen). If cryptocurrency becomes more convinient than fiat currency, why not switch again? If we went into the future and bitcoin was successful, I would be able to explain how it was a natural evolution from hard money. / Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, in a Bloomberg interview. Properties of bitcoin In the section [Properties of money] we listed the following characterics: Scarce, durable, portable, divisible, fungible, uniform, easy to verify, hard to fake. Bitcoin has all these properties, whereas gold and fiat only posess a few. Gold Fiat Bitcoin Scarce Yes No Yes Durable Yes Yes Yes Portable No Yes Yes Divisible No Yes Yes Table: Some types of money are better than others. Gold is not portable due to its weight, and not divible without special equipment. Fiat is not scarce because the central bank control the money supply. History is filled with examples of hyperinflation due to hefty increases in the money supply. 2 Bitcoin is scarce because its money supply is fixed to 21 million BTC, and every BTC is divisble to 100 million pieces. Bitcoin is durable and portable since it is digital. << todo i skipped talking about these two. maybe add them maybe not Fungible and uniform (meaning that all units are interchangeable and have the same purchasing power) because otherwise parts of the money will taken out of circulation. Easy to verify but difficult to fake, so that accepting it is easy but fooling others with fake money is difficult. Different blockchains Bitcoin is not the only blockchain, although it is the first famous one. Bitcoin uses a set of technoligies (cryptographic signatures, proof-of-work, blockchain, y, z, etc todo search in vol 2 book, in a chapter about blockchain not bitcoin.) to achieve a specific goal (creating peer-to-peer digital cash). Other blockchain projects uses different sets of technoligies to achieve other goals: Ethereum was created with the intention becoming a distributed computing platform. The XRP ledger was created to solve the issue with slow and expensive global payments, and their software is written to be integrated with the current financial infrastructure. Storj is a peer-to-peer cloud storage application enabling users to rent out their excess disk space, and those users who need extra disk space can purchase cloud storage with cryptocurrency. Augur utilize blockchain technology to build a decentralized prediction market protocol, and can be used to to forecast events such as the weather, natural disasters, elections or tax reforms. Salt is a lending platform todo write Maker todo MKR stablecoin built on ETH write All of the projects mentioned above have different use cases and visions for the future. This attracts a certain set of individuals who find the vision compelling or believe the use case to be of importance. The people following a project's progress and actively discussing it is often called \"the community\". Every project's community have some distinct characterics. Bitcoin's community is convervative, as changes to the protocol is done with causion. Without conensus the protocol remain unchanged. By contrast, many software projects led by companies experience rapid changes as a few selected individuals posess all decision power. Futhermore, the monetary design of bitcoin has roots in Austrian economics, hence people in the bitcoin community have somewhat homogenous views about the world in general and economics in particular. Ethereum's community consists of many web developers, partly bceause the goal of creating a world computer is attractive to web developers, and partly because Ethereum's scripting language Solidity resembles the popular web programming langauge Javascript. The vision and current use case can of course shape a project's community, but it goes the other way around too. The community can have an impact on the vision and the technical progress, either directly (by changing the code since most of it is open source) or indirectly (by gaining political power and forming opinion). It is worth pointing out that cryptocurrencies are evolving -- they are not static because developers are changing the code which affect the current functionality, and advocates might change the opinions of others as well as affect people's vision of the future. We have established that blockchain projects can differ in their visions of the future and their use cases as they try to solve different problems. Can two projects co-exist even though they have they have similar visions and use cases? Yes. They are simply competitors. Among competing blockchain projects there need not emerge a single winner (although network effects exists) since two cryptocurrencies can serve different customer segments. To understand why there is an equillibrium in which several blockchain projects with the same vision and use cases co-exist, consider that blockchains have a set of parameters. Examples of such parameters are: level of decentralization, transaction cost, consensus algorithm, confirmation time, througput, inflation rate, permissions etc. It is impossible to optimize for all parameters. Trade offs must be made. When functionality is increased, security might suffer. When the level of decentralization is decreased, it might be possible to increase throughput. For example, both Ethereum and EOS are virtual computers that developers can build games on but they differ in speed and level of decentralization, so depending on what game is built one might be more suitable than the other. Ethereum use proof of stake as their consensus algorithm, whereas EOS use delegated proof of stake. Arguably EOS is less decentralized than Ethereum, but can enjoy a faster network.

Including cryptocurrency to a traditional portfolio When considering whether or not to invest in an asset, an investor should study the asset not in isolation but rather as a part of the entire portfolio. It does not make sense to exclude Twitter from an equity portfolio simply because the stock is too risky. Instead, we should compare the portfolio with and without Twitter. After comparing the two portfolios' characterics such as sector allocation and risk-return profiles, then and only then the investor can make a proper judgement of whether to include Twitter or not in his portoflio. This was one of the major ways in which portoflio theory changed finance. The effects on risk and reward for including the Blockchain10 certificate in a traditional portfolio is illustrated in Table \\ref{tbl:trd-bl10-bal}. In this table, we compare the risk and reward 3 between investing $100 into three different portoflios. TRD is a traditional portfolio with $60 allocation to stocks and $40 to bonds. BL10 is our Blockchain10 certificate that contains the ten largest cryptocurrencies weighted by market capitalization. BAL is a balanced portfolio with $95 invested in TRD and $5 invested in BL10. By studying the difference between TRD and BAL, it is evident that the historical returns increase substantially but with only a marginal increase in the volatility, thus the sharpe ratio 4 jump from 0.55 in the traditional portfolio to 1.20 in the balanced portfolio.

This trust emerges from the mathematical and game-theoretic properties of the system, without depending on the trustworthiness of individual network participants. / Andreessen Horowitz, https://a16zcrypto.com/ Firstly, trading increase our living standards . The trading of goods predates both writing and money. We know this because money had to be invented for trade, and the first writings ever found were debt ledgers. When humans started trading goods with each other they agreed to do so because both parties were better off after the transaction, thus economic value was created. Both theorical and empirical evidence suggests that trade make us wealthier and increase our living standards substantially. Secondly, trust is needed for trade. If two parties want to transact but do not trust each other, it will be hard to execute the trade. When the trust is too low, it will inhibit the trade. Larger transaction values require more trust. For a long distance transaction the seller might worry that the payment will not arrive, at the same time as the buyer is unsure of the item's durability. All forms of uncertanty is the enemy of trust. Thirdly, we use trusted third parties today to facilitate trades . Trust is built slowly over time. To prevent zero knowledge about the counterparty to inhibit a transaction we use trusted third parties like stock brokers and apartment brokers, whom are employed by large corporations with regonizable names and logotypes. Their role is to increase confidence in the transacting parties. ((What these companies consist of is essentially trained people who perform manual checks. These tasks can be automated by computers so that the employee supervise what the computer is doing rather than having to perform the manual work herself.)) Fourthly, a blockchain digitize trust . It does so in part because the data cannot be tampered with, 1 so that if something is in the blockchain it will stay there. Imagine what this does to uncertanty. The effect is huge. Instead of relying on a trusted third party, the transacting parties can rely on the blockchain. An intriguing question is: how much economic value can be unleashed via trading thanks to the increase in trust and efficiency that blockchain technology can bring? Given that (1) trading increase our living standards, (2) trust is needed for trade, (3) we use trusted third parties today to facilitate trades, and (4) a blockchain digitize trust, the invetable conclusion is that blockchains are useful.","title":"Blockchains are useful"},{"location":"texts/2part2/#internet-of-value-or-a-global-network-of-value-transfers","text":"((The internet have disrupted many industries (e.g. media). Cryptocurrencies can disrupt many industries (e.g. finance).)) What the internet did to transfering information, cryptocurrencies might do to transfering value. This is a bold claim, so let us compare the internet with cryptocurrencies by comparing email with bitcoin. Sending messages via email (bitcoin) was the first real application of the internet (cryptocurrencies). If Alice wants to send an email message (bitcoin payment) to Bob, she must know his public address. For this reason, there were intially only a handful of users and very few emails (payments) sent. Usage was concentrated to people with a lot of technical skills and interest in computers, as the diffuculty of sending messages (payments) were so high. The ease of use increase with time, allowing less techincal people to use it too. Surely it is beneficial and intelectually satisfying to understand the inner working of email (bitcoin) but is is not neccessary in order to use it. For Alice to send an email message (bitcoin payment) to Bob, she must not only know his public address but also her own password (private key). This security feature ensure that only she can send information (value). To send and recieve emails (payments) it does not matter which country Alice or Bob are in -- the reach is global. Moreover, it does not matter if they are human -- the technology works if the protocol is followed. Before email (bitcoin) only be humans could send information (value). The fact that computers can do it introduce the possibility for automation. Before email (bitcoin) there was different networks depending on what type of information you wanted to send (where to send the value). Multiple networks existed, such as fax for documents and telephone for audio (todo include name of banking transfer systems such as SEPA). With the introduction of internet (cryptocurrencies) all these networks were united. << ((todo maybe add a fomo section: a lot of vc money was invested in the early days.

Before there was money, societies relied on gifts and barter -- both of which severly limits trade. Gifts limits a transaction's value and the counterparties we can trade with, since knowing the person or having a history of successful gift exchanges would be required for valuable trades to take place. Another drawback with gifts are that they rely on humans remembering the quality and amount of the good which was recieved -- a common source of conflicts. Barter limits the liquidity and frequence of trade, because if paying in-kind is the only option then both the buyer and the seller must be willing to buy and sell each other's goods simoultaneuously. This requires a coincidence of wants, which is unlikely. For example, what should the fisherman do when he has caught more than he is able to eat? Perhaps the fisherman need clothes, but if his village relies on barter then he must find a tailor today -- otherwise the extra fish will be worthless. The tailor may not be hungry. In this case the fisherman might be able to trade the fish for nuts, the nuts for beer, and the beer for clothes. Obviously the coincidence of wants introduces liquidity and accounting problems: will there be a path from fish to clothes via trading, and what are the appropriate exchange ratios for all goods? In an economy with 100 goods there are 4950 prices to keep track of. Another drawback with barter is that it is almost impossible for a musician to pay his rent. Money solves these problems. All goods can be priced in terms of only one other good so that there are not thousands of exchange rates to keep track of (money is a unit of account). And the musician can recieve money when he plays the piano at a bar (money is a medium of exchange). He can use this money later to pay his rent (money is a store of value). Money can be defined in terms of its functions as a a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Anything that fulfills these properties can be used as money. A more direct way to define money is to say that it is any item (or verifiable record) that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services as well as repayment of debts. From this definition, whose keyword is \"accepted\", it is clear that money works because we believe in it. Consequently money works only if we believe in it.","title":"Definition of money"},{"location":"texts/2part2/#properties-of-money","text":"Some things are more money than others. This is obvious from the defintion of money because some items (or some verifiable records) function better than others. Seashells cannot be used as money on a beach, and cows are worse than silver coins. Since money works because (and if) we believe in it, we clearly have some set of properties money should have. For something to function well as money, it should be: Scarce, so its value is upheld over time. Durable, so it can be used multiple times. Portable, so it can be carried around. Divisible, so that small payments can be made. Fungible and uniform (meaning that all units are interchangeable and have the same purchasing power) because otherwise parts of the money will taken out of circulation. Easy to verify but difficult to fake, so that accepting it is easy but fooling others with fake money is difficult. Intrinsic value is not a property of money, rather, the lack thereof.

They fall under the category of commodity money. All commodity money is easy to understand, and most of them function reasonably well as a unit of account. Some commodities are more money than others, thanks to their proporties such as weight, appearance, divisibility, and scarcity. Gold and solver coins was introduced in 600 BC, and later on many societies used coins that had been issued by their king. Paper money was used in China during the 11th century due to the physical hurdles with commodity money. Gold and silver merchants gave out reciepts which could redeemed for a certain amount of the commodity. This form of money fall under the category of representative money. The reciepts were in essence IOUs because it was the person who held the reciept who had the right to redeem it. Paper money came to Europe during the 13th century, and by the 18th century gold coins had been replaced by paper money backed by gold. This monetary system is referred to as the gold standard. The paper notes were backed by gold in the sense that they were convertible into a certain amount of gold. Currencies backed by gold are sometimes referred to as hard money because gold is a store of value. In the 20th century almost all countries used the gold standard and made these notes legal tender. After the second world war, most countries pegged their currency to the U.S. dollar. In turn, the dollar was pegged to a certain amount of gold. When Nixon abandoned the gold standard in 1971 USD was no longer backed by anything tangible. Countries responded by de-pegging their currency from the dollar and adopted floating exchange rates. Today we use paper money and take it for granted all firms price their goods in some fiat currency such as USD or EUR, but this has not always been the case throughout history. We invented money because it solves practical problems, and we have used different forms of money switching from less convinient solutions (e.g. large stonges and cows) to more convinient forms of money (e.g. coins, paper and digits on a screen). If cryptocurrency becomes more convinient than fiat currency, why not switch again?

Bitcoin uses a set of technoligies (cryptographic signatures, proof-of-work, blockchain, y, z, etc todo search in vol 2 book, in a chapter about blockchain not bitcoin.) to achieve a specific goal (creating peer-to-peer digital cash). Other blockchain projects uses different sets of technoligies to achieve other goals: Ethereum was created with the intention becoming a distributed computing platform. The XRP ledger was created to solve the issue with slow and expensive global payments, and their software is written to be integrated with the current financial infrastructure. Storj is a peer-to-peer cloud storage application enabling users to rent out their excess disk space, and those users who need extra disk space can purchase cloud storage with cryptocurrency.

Salt is a lending platform todo write Maker todo MKR stablecoin built on ETH write All of the projects mentioned above have different use cases and visions for the future. This attracts a certain set of individuals who find the vision compelling or believe the use case to be of importance. The people following a project's progress and actively discussing it is often called \"the community\". Every project's community have some distinct characterics. Bitcoin's community is convervative, as changes to the protocol is done with causion. Without conensus the protocol remain unchanged. By contrast, many software projects led by companies experience rapid changes as a few selected individuals posess all decision power. Futhermore, the monetary design of bitcoin has roots in Austrian economics, hence people in the bitcoin community have somewhat homogenous views about the world in general and economics in particular. Ethereum's community consists of many web developers, partly bceause the goal of creating a world computer is attractive to web developers, and partly because Ethereum's scripting language Solidity resembles the popular web programming langauge Javascript. The vision and current use case can of course shape a project's community, but it goes the other way around too. The community can have an impact on the vision and the technical progress, either directly (by changing the code since most of it is open source) or indirectly (by gaining political power and forming opinion). It is worth pointing out that cryptocurrencies are evolving -- they are not static because developers are changing the code which affect the current functionality, and advocates might change the opinions of others as well as affect people's vision of the future. We have established that blockchain projects can differ in their visions of the future and their use cases as they try to solve different problems. Can two projects co-exist even though they have they have similar visions and use cases? Yes. They are simply competitors. Among competing blockchain projects there need not emerge a single winner (although network effects exists) since two cryptocurrencies can serve different customer segments. To understand why there is an equillibrium in which several blockchain projects with the same vision and use cases co-exist, consider that blockchains have a set of parameters. Examples of such parameters are: level of decentralization, transaction cost, consensus algorithm, confirmation time, througput, inflation rate, permissions etc. It is impossible to optimize for all parameters. Trade offs must be made. When functionality is increased, security might suffer. When the level of decentralization is decreased, it might be possible to increase throughput. For example, both Ethereum and EOS are virtual computers that developers can build games on but they differ in speed and level of decentralization, so depending on what game is built one might be more suitable than the other. Ethereum use proof of stake as their consensus algorithm, whereas EOS use delegated proof of stake. Arguably EOS is less decentralized than Ethereum, but can enjoy a faster network. It was a strategic choice from EOS to do so.
