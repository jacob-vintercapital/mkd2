Part I: Why indexing In traditional financial markets indexing and passive investing is on the rise. Portfolio theory revolutionzed finance in general and the equity market in particular but has not yet influenced the cryptocurrency market. Indexing and traditional finance A passive investor does not try to beat the market, instead, he invests in vehicles like index funds and ETFs tracking the SP500. An active investor, by contrast, tries to outsmart the market by making active bets such as trying to pick the right stock. These bets make it possible for an active investor to perform better or worse than the market. The last 20 years a strong trend has emerged within the financial markets -- passive investing is on the rise. In 2017 the net inflow from active funds to passive index funds were USD 500 billion, as shown in @fig:netflow. {#fig:netflow width=9cm} There are good reasons for investors to put their money into passive vehicles. Academic studies have shown that trying to beat the market is an unprofitable strategy. For an overview of the literature see for example Fama's paper \"Efficient Capital Markets\" published in the Journal of Finance, 1969. To understand why passive investing beats active, consider the following sequential logical argumentation, written in the form of three statements: Active managers cannot collectively beat the market. Sub-groups of active investors do not beat their index. Top performers do not stay top performers. The first statement is just plain arithmetic and was proved by Sharpe in his article \"The Arithmetic of Active Management\" published in the Financial Analysts Journal, 1991. Some active managers must have returns higher the market, and some must have returns lower than the market. As a collective, they will have a return equal to the market. After including fees, however, the all active investors will be beaten by the market due to trading costs. The second statement is proved by empirical studies. Active managers investing in a certain style (e.g. stocks with high dividend yield or small cap growth stocks) do not beat their sub-index. This makes intuitive sense because almost any style can be replicated with an index, and since indices are less costly than portfolio managers an investor can get the same return for a lower fee. The last line of defence for active investing is that whilst the two previous statements are true, there exists people who can make the right judgement call and beat the market consistently. Data suggests the opposite. Every year, some investors do indeed beat the market, but these investors are different persons from year to year. By ranking the portfolio managers in one period, and then studying how they performed in subsequent periods, it is evident that the top performers do not stay top performers. This is logical, since risk taking can give extreme returns -- sometimes extremely positive and sometimes extremely negative. The performance of active money managers provides the best evidence yet that indexing may be the best strategy for many investors. / A. Damodaran, Professor of Finance at NYU. Diversification Portfolio theory has had a huge impact on finance. Markowitz, who won the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, invented portfolio theory in 1952 with his famous paper \"Portfolio Selection\" published in the Journal of Finance. Portfolio theory changed the lens through which assets are considered. Before Markowitz, investors held a small number of stocks and tended to evaluate their stocks in isolation. Today, almost all investors evaluate their portfolio as a whole before buying or selling assets. To understand why portfolios are attractive investments, we can utilize an \"efficient frontier\" in @fig:eff-front-simple. Most standard textbooks on portfolio theory contain a version of this figure, in which we see a collection of assets with their historical volatility on the x-axis and their expected return on the y-axis. Holding one of these assets will give the investor a certain risk (volatility) for a certain reward (return). {#fig:eff-front-simple width=9cm} Investors want high returns and low volatility, so the upper left corner is an ideal place to be. When comparing assets against each other there is, of course, a trade-off between risk and reward: taking on more risk (by for example selling some T-bills and investing in a startup) does increase the expected return but also leads to higher volatility. The efficient frontier is the set of (volatility, return)-points the investor can get if she buys a portfolio of assets, and it is illustrated with a solid black line in @fig:eff-front-simple. Every single point on the efficient frontier is a portfolio the investor can have. The efficient frontier is located close to the ideal upper left corner, reflecting the fact that efficient portfolios are more attractive than owning a single asset. The reason for this is diversification. {#fig:cor-stocks width=9cm} Correlation is the driver of diversification. When assets are correlated less than 1.00 with each other, it is possible to increase the risk-adjusted returns by diversifying. The lower the correlations between the assets, the more the efficient frontier will expand to the upper left corner. In @fig:cor-stocks we see the correlation between 10 important constituents of the SP500: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, J.P. Morgan, Facebook, Exxon and Google. Since the correlation between individual equities is below 1.00 they are sutiable to be put into a basket like the SP500. Here is an important but subtle point: Even though an asset like gold might have inferior risk-adjusted returns to some stocks, it can be rational for an investor to include gold in his portfolio because doing so improves the portfolio as a whole. Diversification stems from correlation, and if gold has a low correlation with stocks then including it will lead to better risk-adjusted returns for the entire portfolio. Indexing and cryptocurrencies Portfolio theory has not influenced the cryptocurrency market yet. As the market matures, Markowitz ideas There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, and many hundreds are traded on large exchanges. But out of the few people that have bought cryptocurrencies, owning only 1-3 different ones is the norm. Just like different companies operate in distinct sectors, different cryptocurrencies try to solve different problems -- some focus on building a general purpose scripting language and others on integrating their software with the current banking system. Just like stocks, cryptocurrencies have a correlation that makes them suitable to be put in a basket. As seen in @fig:cor-t10now, the correlation between cryptocurrencies is even lower than the correlation between equities. In this regard, indexing makes even more sense with cryptocurrencies than it does for the equity market. {#fig:cor-t10now width=9cm} One way to understand how diversificaiton can work in practice is to consider the \"performance reversals\" for cryptocurrencies. For a long period Bitcoin outperformed almost all other cryptocurrencies. But during the price drop of Bitcoin in January 2018, three of the top 10 digital assets -- EOS, NEO and XLM -- realized positive returns. Only twice in 12 months has the most profitable cryptocurrency repeated the feat of having the highest in the following month. 5 These performance reversals clearly demonstrate the benefits of diversification. It also provides a good reason to buy a slice of the market, instead of trying to pick a few assets and hope they will perform. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486 Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work, Eugene F.

Out of the hundres of currencies available, the most viable options are: U.S. dollars, euros, british punds, schweizer franc, japense yen, and maybe -- depending on where you live -- your own home currency. The limited number of reasonable answers out of the many possible choices reveal an important fact about money: some are better than others. History of money or Evolution of money Throughout history we have used many forms of money: seashells, knifes, cows, alcohol, and large stones formed in the shape of doughnuts. They fall under the category of commodity money. All commodity money is easy to understand, and most of them function reasonably well as a unit of account. Some commodities are more money than others, thanks to their proporties such as weight, appearance, divisibility, and scarcity. Gold and solver coins was introduced in 600 BC, and later on many societies used coins that had been issued by their king. Paper money was used in China during the 11th century due to the physical hurdles with commodity money. Gold and silver merchants gave out reciepts which could redeemed for a certain amount of the commodity. This form of money fall under the category of representative money. The reciepts were in essence \"I owe you\" notes because it was the person who held the reciept who had the right to redeem it. Paper money came to Europe during the 13th century, and by the 18th century gold coins had been replaced by paper money backed by gold. This monetary system is referred to as the gold standard. The paper notes were backed by gold in the sense that they were convertible into a certain amount of gold. Currencies backed by gold are sometimes referred to as hard money because gold is a store of value. In the 20th century almost all countries used the gold standard and made these notes legal tender. After the second world war, most countries pegged their currency to the U.S. dollar. In turn, the dollar was pegged to a certain amount of gold. When Nixon abandoned the gold standard in 1971 USD was no longer backed by anything tangible. Countries responded by de-pegging their currency from the dollar, and adopted floating exchange rates which we have today. Today we use paper money and take it for granted all firms price their goods in some fiat currencies like USD or EUR, but this has not always been the case throughout history. We invented money because it solves practical problems, and we have used different forms of money switching from less convinient solutions (e.g. large stonges and cows) to more convinient forms of money (e.g. coins, paper and digits on a screen). If cryptocurrency becomes more convinient than fiat currency why not use it? If we went into the future and bitcoin was successful, I would be able to explain how it was a natural evolution from hard money. / Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, in a Bloomberg interview. Definition of money Money had to be invented for trade. Before there was money, societies relied on gifts and barter -- both of which severly limits trade. Gifts limits a transaction's value and the counterparties we can trade with, since knowing the person or having a history of successful gift exchanges would be required for valuable trades to take place. Another drawback with gifts are that they rely on humans remembering the quality and amount of the good which was recieved -- a common source of conflicts. Barter limits the liquidity and frequence of trade, because if paying in-kind is the only option then both the buyer and the seller must be willing to buy and sell each other's goods simoultaneuously. This requires a coincidence of wants, which is unlikely. For example, what should the fisherman do when he has caught more than he is able to eat? Perhaps the fisherman need clothes, but if his village relies on barter then he must find a tailor today -- otherwise the extra fish will be worthless. The tailor may not be hungry. In this case the fisherman might be able to trade the fish for nuts, the nuts for beer, and the beer for clothes. Obviously the coincidence of wants introduces liquidity and accounting problems: will there be a path from fish to clothes via trading, and what are the appropriate exchange ratios for all goods? In an economy with 100 goods there are 4950 prices to keep track of. Another drawback with barter is that it is almost impossible for a musician to pay his rent. Money solves these problems. The invention of money allow us to trade more valuable goods at an increased frequency with more counterparties. Moreover, all goods can be priced in terms of only one other good so that there are not thousands of exchange rates to keep track of (money is a unit of account). And the musician can recieve money when he plays the piano at a bar (money is a medium of exchange). He can use this money later to pay his rent (money is a store of value). Money can be defined in terms of its functions as a a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Anything that fulfills these properties can be used as money. A more direct way to define money is to say that it is any item (or verifiable record) that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services as well as repayment of debts. From this definition, whose keyword is \"accepted\", it is clear that money works because we believe in it. Consequently money works only if we believe in it. Properties of money Some things are more money than others. This is obvious from the defintion of money because some items (or some verifiable records) function better than others. Seashells cannot be used as money on a beach, and cows are worse than silver coins. Since money works because -- and if -- we believe in it, there are clearly some set of properties money should have. For something to function well as money, it should be: Scarce, so its value is upheld over time. Durable, so it can be used multiple times. Portable, so it can be carried around. Divisible, so that small payments can be made. Fungible and uniform (meaning that all units are interchangeable and have the same purchasing power) because otherwise parts of the money will taken out of circulation. Easy to verify but difficult to fake, so that accepting it is easy but fooling others with fake money is difficult. Intrinsic value is not a property of money, rather, the lack thereof. A paper bill is not worth anything in and of itself. The value comes from the fact that humans agree to accept it as means of payment for valuable goods and services. Properties of bitcoin Bitcoin is scarce, durable, portable, divisible, fungible, uniform, easy to verify and hard to fake. Gold and fiat, by contrast, only posess a few of these properties. Gold Fiat Bitcoin Scarce Yes No Yes Durable Yes Yes Yes Portable No Yes Yes Divisible No Yes Yes Table: Some types of money are better than others. Gold is not portable due to its weight, and not divible without special equipment. Fiat currencies like USD and EUR need not be scarce because a central bank controls the money supply. History is filled with examples of hyperinflation due to hefty increases in the money supply. 2 Bitcoin is scarce because its money supply is currently fixed to 21 million BTC, and every BTC is divisble to 100 million pieces. Bitcoin is durable and portable since it is digital. Internet of value or A global network of value transfers ((The internet have disrupted many industries (e.g. media). Cryptocurrencies can disrupt many industries (e.g. finance).)) What the internet did to transfering information, cryptocurrencies might do to transfering value. This is a bold claim, so let us compare the internet with cryptocurrencies by comparing email with bitcoin.below. Sending messages via email (bitcoin) was the first real application of the internet (cryptocurrencies). If Alice wants to send an email message (bitcoin payment) to Bob, she must know his public address. For this reason, there were intially only a handful of users and very few emails (payments) sent. Usage was concentrated to people with a lot of technical skills and interest in computers, as the diffuculty of sending messages (payments) were so high. The ease of use increase with time, allowing less techincal people to use it too. Surely it is beneficial and intelectually satisfying to understand the inner working of email (bitcoin) but is is not neccessary in order to use it. For Alice to send an email message (bitcoin payment) to Bob, she must not only know his public address but also her own password (private key). This security feature ensure that only she can send information (value). To send and recieve emails (payments) it does not matter which country Alice or Bob are in -- the reach is global. Moreover, it does not matter if they are human -- the technology works if the protocol is followed. Before email (bitcoin) only be humans could send information (value). The fact that computers can do it introduce the possibility for automation. Before email (bitcoin) there was different networks depending on what type of information you wanted to send (where to send the value). Multiple networks existed, such as fax for documents and telephone for audio (todo include name of banking transfer systems such as SEPA). With the introduction of internet (cryptocurrencies) all these networks were united. << ((todo maybe add a fomo section: a lot of vc money was invested in the early days. (include data point). )) << to get a table, see the file comparison.ods . its current content is pasted below. Internet Cryptocurrency Use case Sending information Sending value First app Email Bitcoin Reach Global Global Usability in the beginning Difficult Difficult Usability after 20 years Easy Do not know yet Before Different networks: Fax, telephone. Different networks: SEPA, todo After One network to send information One network to send value Easy to understand No No Can use w/o understanding it Yes Yes VC money invested A lot A lot Table: Internet and cryptocurrencies share some similiarities. \\label{tab:email-bitcoin} Blockchains are useful Blockchain computers are new types of computers where the unique capability is trust between users, developers, and the platform itself. This trust emerges from the mathematical and game-theoretic properties of the system, without depending on the trustworthiness of individual network participants. / Andreessen Horowitz, https://a16zcrypto.com/ Firstly, trading increase our living standards . The trading of goods predates both writing and money. We know this because money had to be invented for trade, and the first writings ever found were debt ledgers. When humans started trading goods with each other they agreed to do so because both parties were better off after the transaction, thus economic value was created. Both theorical and empirical evidence suggests that trade make us wealthier and increase our living standards substantially. Secondly, trust is needed for trade. If two parties want to transact but do not trust each other, it will be hard to execute the trade. When the trust is too low, it will inhibit the trade. Larger transaction values require more trust. For a long distance transaction the seller might worry that the payment will not arrive, at the same time as the buyer is unsure of the item's durability. All forms of uncertanty is the enemy of trust. Thirdly, we use trusted third parties today to facilitate trades . Trust is built slowly over time. To prevent zero knowledge about the counterparty to inhibit a transaction we use trusted third parties like stock brokers and apartment brokers, whom are employed by large corporations with regonizable names and logotypes. Their role is to increase confidence in the transacting parties. ((What these companies consist of is essentially trained people who perform manual checks. These tasks can be automated by computers so that the employee supervise what the computer is doing rather than having to perform the manual work herself.)) Fourthly, a blockchain digitize trust . It does so in part because the data cannot be tampered with, 1 so that if something is in the blockchain it will stay there. Imagine what this does to uncertanty. Blockchains are a cheap way to instull trust. Instead of relying on a trusted third party, the transacting parties can rely on the blockchain. This digitization reduces transaction costs and enables trade. An intriguing question is: how much economic value can be unleashed via trading thanks to the increase in trust and efficiency that blockchain technology can bring? Given that (1) trading increase our living standards, (2) trust is needed for trade, (3) we use trusted third parties today to facilitate trades, and (4) a blockchain digitize trust, the invetable conclusion is that blockchains are useful. Different blockchains Bitcoin is not the only blockchain, although it is the first famous one. Bitcoin uses a set of technoligies (cryptographic signatures, proof-of-work, blockchain, y, z, etc todo search in vol 2 book, in a chapter about blockchain not bitcoin.) to achieve a specific goal (creating peer-to-peer digital cash). Other blockchain projects uses different sets of technoligies to achieve other goals: Ethereum was created with the intention becoming a distributed computing platform. The XRP ledger was created to solve the issue with slow and expensive global payments, and their software is written to be integrated with the current financial infrastructure. Storj is a peer-to-peer cloud storage application enabling users to rent out their excess disk space, and those users who need extra disk space can purchase cloud storage with cryptocurrency. Augur utilize blockchain technology to build a decentralized prediction market protocol, and can be used to to forecast events such as the weather, natural disasters, elections or tax reforms. Salt is a lending platform todo write Maker todo MKR stablecoin built on ETH write All of the projects mentioned above have different use cases and visions for the future. This attracts a certain set of individuals who find the vision compelling or believe the use case to be of importance. The people following a project's progress and actively discussing it is often called \"the community\". Every project's community have some distinct characterics. Bitcoin's community is convervative, as changes to the protocol is done with causion. Without conensus the protocol remain unchanged. By contrast, many software projects led by companies experience rapid changes as a few selected individuals posess all decision power. Futhermore, the monetary design of bitcoin has roots in Austrian economics, hence people in the bitcoin community have somewhat homogenous views about the world in general and economics in particular. Ethereum's community consists of many web developers, partly bceause the goal of creating a world computer is attractive to web developers, and partly because Ethereum's scripting language Solidity resembles the popular web programming langauge Javascript. The vision and current use case can of course shape a project's community, but it goes the other way around too. The community can have an impact on the vision and the technical progress, either directly (by changing the code since most of it is open source) or indirectly (by gaining political power and forming opinion). It is worth pointing out that cryptocurrencies are evolving -- they are not static because developers are changing the code which affect the current functionality, and advocates might change the opinions of others as well as affect people's vision of the future. We have established that blockchain projects can differ in their visions of the future and their use cases as they try to solve different problems. Can two projects co-exist even though they have they have similar visions and use cases? Yes. They are simply competitors. Among competing blockchain projects there need not emerge a single winner (although network effects exists) since two cryptocurrencies can serve different customer segments. To understand why there is an equillibrium in which several blockchain projects with the same vision and use cases co-exist, consider that blockchains have a set of parameters. Examples of such parameters are: level of decentralization, transaction cost, consensus algorithm, confirmation time, througput, inflation rate, permissions etc. It is impossible to optimize for all parameters. Trade offs must be made. When functionality is increased, security might suffer. When the level of decentralization is decreased, it might be possible to increase throughput. For example, both Ethereum and EOS are virtual computers that developers can build games on but they differ in speed and level of decentralization, so depending on what game is built one might be more suitable than the other. Ethereum use proof of stake as their consensus algorithm, whereas EOS use delegated proof of stake. Arguably EOS is less decentralized than Ethereum, but can enjoy a faster network. It was a strategic choice from EOS to do so. Thus there is an equilibrium where there are several blockchains trying to serve the same customers in different ways. << todo it is proof of stake Some people have called me a \"bitcoin maximalist\". I am not a bitcoin maximalist. I am interested in the possibility of open, public, borderless, decentralized, permission-less blockhains, disrupting evrything. In that space, I think there is plenty of room for many different approaches to many different problems. / A. Antonopoulos The internet of money, vol 2, chapter 10 \"The lion and the shark\". Cryptocurrency as an investment Even though there are thousands of cryptocurrencies of which hundreds are actively traded on exchanges, most people who have bought cryptocurrency only hold 1-3 different ones. By contrast, an investor rarely hold only 1-3 equities, although they did before Markowitz introduced portfolio theory. As the crypto market matures, people will probably hold a diversified basket of cryptocurrencies. This will be especially true for investors who primarily seek attractive risk-adjusted returns and does not identify with a particular coin or care to be a part of its community. Market forces will decide which blockcain projects are important and which are not. Competition will wash out the bad cryptocurrencies and reward projects with a compelling vision, competent team, dedicated community, functioning applications. In the end, the best cryptocurrencies will win. At Vinter Capital, we do not know who the winners will be. Nor do we do pretend to know. Instead, we have provided a crypto index designed for the passive investor. ((For further details about why indexing makes sense for financial assets in general and cryptocurrencies in particular, as well as evidence that beating the market is an unprofitable strategy, see part I.)) When considering whether or not to invest in an asset, an investor should study the asset not in isolation but rather as a part of the entire portfolio. It does not make sense to exclude Twitter from an equity portfolio simply because the stock is too risky. Instead, we should compare the portfolio with and without Twitter. After comparing the two portfolios' characterics such as sector allocation and risk-return profiles, then and only then the investor can make a proper judgement of whether to include Twitter or not in his portoflio. This was one of the major ways in which portoflio theory changed finance. The effects on risk and reward for including the Blockchain10 certificate in a traditional portfolio is illustrated in Table \\ref{tbl:trd-bl10-bal}. In this table, we compare the risk and reward 3 between investing $100 into three different portoflios. TRD is a traditional portfolio with $60 allocation to stocks and $40 to bonds. BL10 is our Blockchain10 certificate that contains the ten largest cryptocurrencies weighted by market capitalization. BAL is a balanced portfolio with $95 invested in TRD and $5 invested in BL10. By studying the difference between TRD and BAL, it is evident that the historical returns increase substantially but with only a marginal increase in the volatility, thus the sharpe ratio 4 jump from 0.55 in the traditional portfolio to 1.20 in the balanced portfolio.

They fall under the category of commodity money. All commodity money is easy to understand, and most of them function reasonably well as a unit of account. Some commodities are more money than others, thanks to their proporties such as weight, appearance, divisibility, and scarcity. Gold and solver coins was introduced in 600 BC, and later on many societies used coins that had been issued by their king. Paper money was used in China during the 11th century due to the physical hurdles with commodity money. Gold and silver merchants gave out reciepts which could redeemed for a certain amount of the commodity. This form of money fall under the category of representative money. The reciepts were in essence \"I owe you\" notes because it was the person who held the reciept who had the right to redeem it. Paper money came to Europe during the 13th century, and by the 18th century gold coins had been replaced by paper money backed by gold. This monetary system is referred to as the gold standard. The paper notes were backed by gold in the sense that they were convertible into a certain amount of gold. Currencies backed by gold are sometimes referred to as hard money because gold is a store of value. In the 20th century almost all countries used the gold standard and made these notes legal tender. After the second world war, most countries pegged their currency to the U.S. dollar. In turn, the dollar was pegged to a certain amount of gold. When Nixon abandoned the gold standard in 1971 USD was no longer backed by anything tangible. Countries responded by de-pegging their currency from the dollar, and adopted floating exchange rates which we have today. Today we use paper money and take it for granted all firms price their goods in some fiat currencies like USD or EUR, but this has not always been the case throughout history. We invented money because it solves practical problems, and we have used different forms of money switching from less convinient solutions (e.g. large stonges and cows) to more convinient forms of money (e.g. coins, paper and digits on a screen). If cryptocurrency becomes more convinient than fiat currency why not use it? If we went into the future and bitcoin was successful, I would be able to explain how it was a natural evolution from hard money. / Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, in a Bloomberg interview.","title":"History of money or Evolution of money"},{"location":"texts/2part2/#definition-of-money","text":"Money had to be invented for trade. Before there was money, societies relied on gifts and barter -- both of which severly limits trade. Gifts limits a transaction's value and the counterparties we can trade with, since knowing the person or having a history of successful gift exchanges would be required for valuable trades to take place. Another drawback with gifts are that they rely on humans remembering the quality and amount of the good which was recieved -- a common source of conflicts. Barter limits the liquidity and frequence of trade, because if paying in-kind is the only option then both the buyer and the seller must be willing to buy and sell each other's goods simoultaneuously. This requires a coincidence of wants, which is unlikely. For example, what should the fisherman do when he has caught more than he is able to eat? Perhaps the fisherman need clothes, but if his village relies on barter then he must find a tailor today -- otherwise the extra fish will be worthless. The tailor may not be hungry. In this case the fisherman might be able to trade the fish for nuts, the nuts for beer, and the beer for clothes. Obviously the coincidence of wants introduces liquidity and accounting problems: will there be a path from fish to clothes via trading, and what are the appropriate exchange ratios for all goods? In an economy with 100 goods there are 4950 prices to keep track of. Another drawback with barter is that it is almost impossible for a musician to pay his rent. Money solves these problems. The invention of money allow us to trade more valuable goods at an increased frequency with more counterparties. Moreover, all goods can be priced in terms of only one other good so that there are not thousands of exchange rates to keep track of (money is a unit of account). And the musician can recieve money when he plays the piano at a bar (money is a medium of exchange). He can use this money later to pay his rent (money is a store of value). Money can be defined in terms of its functions as a a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Anything that fulfills these properties can be used as money. A more direct way to define money is to say that it is any item (or verifiable record) that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services as well as repayment of debts. From this definition, whose keyword is \"accepted\", it is clear that money works because we believe in it. Consequently money works only if we believe in it.","title":"Definition of money"},{"location":"texts/2part2/#properties-of-money","text":"Some things are more money than others.

For something to function well as money, it should be: Scarce, so its value is upheld over time. Durable, so it can be used multiple times. Portable, so it can be carried around. Divisible, so that small payments can be made. Fungible and uniform (meaning that all units are interchangeable and have the same purchasing power) because otherwise parts of the money will taken out of circulation. Easy to verify but difficult to fake, so that accepting it is easy but fooling others with fake money is difficult. Intrinsic value is not a property of money, rather, the lack thereof.

Cryptocurrencies can disrupt many industries (e.g. finance).)) What the internet did to transfering information, cryptocurrencies might do to transfering value. This is a bold claim, so let us compare the internet with cryptocurrencies by comparing email with bitcoin.below. Sending messages via email (bitcoin) was the first real application of the internet (cryptocurrencies). If Alice wants to send an email message (bitcoin payment) to Bob, she must know his public address. For this reason, there were intially only a handful of users and very few emails (payments) sent. Usage was concentrated to people with a lot of technical skills and interest in computers, as the diffuculty of sending messages (payments) were so high. The ease of use increase with time, allowing less techincal people to use it too. Surely it is beneficial and intelectually satisfying to understand the inner working of email (bitcoin) but is is not neccessary in order to use it. For Alice to send an email message (bitcoin payment) to Bob, she must not only know his public address but also her own password (private key). This security feature ensure that only she can send information (value). To send and recieve emails (payments) it does not matter which country Alice or Bob are in -- the reach is global. Moreover, it does not matter if they are human -- the technology works if the protocol is followed. Before email (bitcoin) only be humans could send information (value). The fact that computers can do it introduce the possibility for automation. Before email (bitcoin) there was different networks depending on what type of information you wanted to send (where to send the value).

This trust emerges from the mathematical and game-theoretic properties of the system, without depending on the trustworthiness of individual network participants. / Andreessen Horowitz, https://a16zcrypto.com/ Firstly, trading increase our living standards . The trading of goods predates both writing and money. We know this because money had to be invented for trade, and the first writings ever found were debt ledgers. When humans started trading goods with each other they agreed to do so because both parties were better off after the transaction, thus economic value was created. Both theorical and empirical evidence suggests that trade make us wealthier and increase our living standards substantially. Secondly, trust is needed for trade. If two parties want to transact but do not trust each other, it will be hard to execute the trade. When the trust is too low, it will inhibit the trade. Larger transaction values require more trust. For a long distance transaction the seller might worry that the payment will not arrive, at the same time as the buyer is unsure of the item's durability. All forms of uncertanty is the enemy of trust. Thirdly, we use trusted third parties today to facilitate trades . Trust is built slowly over time. To prevent zero knowledge about the counterparty to inhibit a transaction we use trusted third parties like stock brokers and apartment brokers, whom are employed by large corporations with regonizable names and logotypes. Their role is to increase confidence in the transacting parties. ((What these companies consist of is essentially trained people who perform manual checks. These tasks can be automated by computers so that the employee supervise what the computer is doing rather than having to perform the manual work herself.)) Fourthly, a blockchain digitize trust . It does so in part because the data cannot be tampered with, 1 so that if something is in the blockchain it will stay there. Imagine what this does to uncertanty. Blockchains are a cheap way to instull trust. Instead of relying on a trusted third party, the transacting parties can rely on the blockchain. This digitization reduces transaction costs and enables trade. An intriguing question is: how much economic value can be unleashed via trading thanks to the increase in trust and efficiency that blockchain technology can bring? Given that (1) trading increase our living standards, (2) trust is needed for trade, (3) we use trusted third parties today to facilitate trades, and (4) a blockchain digitize trust, the invetable conclusion is that blockchains are useful.","title":"Blockchains are useful"},{"location":"texts/2part2/#different-blockchains","text":"Bitcoin is not the only blockchain, although it is the first famous one.

Other blockchain projects uses different sets of technoligies to achieve other goals: Ethereum was created with the intention becoming a distributed computing platform.

This attracts a certain set of individuals who find the vision compelling or believe the use case to be of importance. The people following a project's progress and actively discussing it is often called \"the community\". Every project's community have some distinct characterics. Bitcoin's community is convervative, as changes to the protocol is done with causion. Without conensus the protocol remain unchanged. By contrast, many software projects led by companies experience rapid changes as a few selected individuals posess all decision power. Futhermore, the monetary design of bitcoin has roots in Austrian economics, hence people in the bitcoin community have somewhat homogenous views about the world in general and economics in particular. Ethereum's community consists of many web developers, partly bceause the goal of creating a world computer is attractive to web developers, and partly because Ethereum's scripting language Solidity resembles the popular web programming langauge Javascript. The vision and current use case can of course shape a project's community, but it goes the other way around too. The community can have an impact on the vision and the technical progress, either directly (by changing the code since most of it is open source) or indirectly (by gaining political power and forming opinion). It is worth pointing out that cryptocurrencies are evolving -- they are not static because developers are changing the code which affect the current functionality, and advocates might change the opinions of others as well as affect people's vision of the future. We have established that blockchain projects can differ in their visions of the future and their use cases as they try to solve different problems. Can two projects co-exist even though they have they have similar visions and use cases? Yes. They are simply competitors. Among competing blockchain projects there need not emerge a single winner (although network effects exists) since two cryptocurrencies can serve different customer segments. To understand why there is an equillibrium in which several blockchain projects with the same vision and use cases co-exist, consider that blockchains have a set of parameters. Examples of such parameters are: level of decentralization, transaction cost, consensus algorithm, confirmation time, througput, inflation rate, permissions etc. It is impossible to optimize for all parameters. Trade offs must be made. When functionality is increased, security might suffer. When the level of decentralization is decreased, it might be possible to increase throughput. For example, both Ethereum and EOS are virtual computers that developers can build games on but they differ in speed and level of decentralization, so depending on what game is built one might be more suitable than the other. Ethereum use proof of stake as their consensus algorithm, whereas EOS use delegated proof of stake. Arguably EOS is less decentralized than Ethereum, but can enjoy a faster network. It was a strategic choice from EOS to do so. Thus there is an equilibrium where there are several blockchains trying to serve the same customers in different ways. << todo it is proof of stake Some people have called me a \"bitcoin maximalist\".

Here in part III we ask: What activities are required in order to passively invest in the crypto market? Firstly, we explain why passive crypto investing is almost impossible in practice. Secondly, we discuss how our product solves these problems. Thirdly, we bring up some additional benefits our product provides. Lastly, we draw some comparisons between us and the competition. Difficult to buy Our team have registered accounts at over 20 exchanges. To register an account and fulfill the KYC requirements, a user must send copies of gas bills, photos of passport and sometimes download a video conferencing app to have a video call with the on-boarding team. Waiting times are long -- often several days. Patience is a virtue, and the registration process is a real test of patience. Different exchanges have different user interfaces. This can make order placing confusing when the customer is used to a certain interface and suddenly the order book is visualized a different way, or the buy button is on the left instead of on the right. Obviously this slows down the speed at which trades can be executed and increases the risk for human errors. Different exchanges also have different trading rules on order size, leverage, maker and taker fees etc. Moreover, the same virtual currency can have different names on different exchanges -- bitcoin can for example have the ticker BTC or XBT. Differences between exchanges increase the risk for manual errors. For many investors, registering at a single exchange is insufficient due to: asset coverage, technical reliability, liquidity and pricing. All four reasons are discussed below. Asset coverage is a problem for an investor who want to trade the top 10 cryptocurrencies because all them might not be listed -- Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges but has not listed the top 10 assets. Technical reliability and up-time has been a problem for many exchanges, especially during periods when many want to trade or open up new accounts such as during the boom of 2017. During this boom, when many new investors wanted to register to buy and some old investors wanted to sell, even the largest exchanges like Kraken and Binance experienced severe problems. Kraken was down so people who really wanted to trade could not. Binance stopped taking on more customers. For times like these investors who have registered at many exchanges have a much higher probability of being able to execute trades. Liquidity is the third reason to register at several exchanges. When buying large amounts of crypto or buying small cap cryptocurrencies, the order book might not be deep enough. In these cases it is beneficial to spread out the trade on several exchanges. Pricing is the last and most obvious reason: sometimes the price on one exchange is more favorable than another. << todo sid provide source that most people bought 1-3 different ones. i say that in part ii also. Difficult to store Traditional financial instruments, like stocks and bonds, are stored at a central securities deposit or custodian such as Euroclear. When buying these assets the investor can enjoy the storage solution his bank provides, giving him piece of mind. Cryptocurrencies, in contrast, are stored by the owner. This is a common source of headache for cryptocurrency investors. Storage is important and complicated. To quantify the importance of storage is easy because losing the password implies a return of minus 100 percent. To quantify how complicated it is to store the digital assets safely, consider that USD 670 million worth of cryptocurrencies were lost in the first quarter of 2018 due to bad storage or theft. 1 When the previous exchange Mt. Gox was hacked, 850 thousand bitcoins were stolen. Assuming a BTCUSD price of 6000 this hack was worth USD 5.1 billion. Apart from protecting against thieves, all cryptocurrency users must be protected against themselves. Even though users are heavily incentivized to store their digital wealth with care, stories of lost coins are plentiful. One common way is to forget the password. Another is to throw away the laptop when the coins were not worth that much just to realize a year later they threw away thousands of dollars. 2 History provides a clear conclusion: users are not skilled at storing their own digital wealth. Safely storing the digital assets is hard partly because the technology is in its infancy. Anyone who has bought and safely stored cryptocurrencies know this. Further, the human brain is trained to hide physical objects but not digital information. This fact about our human nature make digital security unintuitive. The storage complications provide a good reason for investors to stay away from the crypto market. Institutional investors cannot afford to buy an asset when the risk of loosing it so high. The technical knowledge needed to safely store coins takes time to acquire, and investors with deep pockets have a high opportunity cost. Portfolio managers that are asked why they have not bought cryptocurrencies often state volatility as a primary reason, but storage is in fact a much larger problem (especially since higher volatility is accompanied with higher returns).

What does he have to follow this strategy? David must begin by choosing a suitable index to follow. At its core, an index is a set of rules. Let us decide on an index that contains the 10 largest virtual currencies, weighted by their market capitalization. The index is rebalanced monthly to keep up to date with changes in the market. On the first day, David must take his USD and buy 10 different coins. He wants to safely store the assets himself, so after the purchase he must move the coins from the exchange to his personal wallets. This act is called moving to cold storage. Setting up a safe storage solution for a single coin is difficult, as described above. Storing 10 different coins increases the difficulty tenfold, because every coin has its own wallet, so storing a basket of coins requires multiple software applications. Every application has its password and preferences. Naturally, David must spend some time to store all cons in safe places. Increasing and decreasing the portfolio's asset under management are two important activities. David might want to save a fixed amount every month. Or he might want to let cryptocurrencies have around 5% weight in his total portfolio which otherwise consist of an equity index. If so, he needs to buy more coins when the value of crypto decreases and sell them when the value of crypto increases (relative to the equity index) in order to keep his 5% weight intact. Regardless of the reason why David wants to increase or decrease the asset under management in his cryptocurrency portfolio, he must repeat the tiresome process of buying at several exchanges and safely storing into separate wallets. This is difficult and can take hours even for an experienced user. A month after his first purchase, David should rebalance his cryptocurrency portfolio. In fact, he should rebalance it every month. Monthly rebalancing is needed because he wants to own the current market, not the market how it looked a when he made his first purchase. For a passive investor rebalancing is necessary and most equity index funds do this automatically (every quarter or so) without any action needed from the investor. In the world of cryptocurrencies, however, rebalancing is a tough manual task. Rebalancing starts with David transfering the coins from his wallet to the exchange. With several windows open on his computer screens, he will then proceed with executing the trades needed to rebalance his portfolio. As a final step, he sends the coins to cold storage. This is simple in theory but hard in practice with many manual steps. As a simplified example, consider how the rebalancing process would look if the only event that occurred during a month was that the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency ZEC went from place 11 to 10, while the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency ADA went from place 10 to 11. David must first move his coins from the ADA wallet to an exchange that contain both ADA and ZEC. His choice of which exchange to use will vary depending on a combination of factors: prices for ADA and ZEC, the order books for ADA and ZEC, and how familiar David is with an exchange's interface. When ADA is at the exchange, he can proceed by selling ADA for US dollars, and then buy ZEC with these dollars. Lastly, he will send ZEC to cold storage. If this was the first time ZEC entered the top 10 index, David would most likely not know a lot about this coin or how its wallet software works in practice. In order to be competent enough and not make a mistake that might cause him to loose the coins, he would have to spend hours reading about ZEC and trying out software. Th process described above is a mess! The technical barrier is too high. This is a real hinder for investors. Even though it is a simplified example, there are many steps which require research, experience and computer skills. Mistakes are fatal as they can cause the digital wealth to be erased. We believe there is a better way forward, and that is why we created the Blockchain10 index. Product: an index and a certificate or Our product We have created the Blockchain10 index. It is a diversified index that tracks the cryptocurrency market returns in a similar way that the SP500 tracks the American stock market returns. The index consist of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, weighted by market capitalization. These 10 cover more than 80% of the total market capitalization. The index is rebalanced monthly. We will issue an exchange traded note that follows our index. It will be traded on regulated exchanges to provide retail and institutional investors a diversified exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Our product is simple, secure, and diverse. Simple : investors can buy it at their existing broker like Nordnet. There is no need to register at crypto exchanges and get familiar with their trading interface. More importantly, the investor does not have to send money to the crypto exchange -- a new company that she might not feel too comfortable with. Secure : investors can get custody of their digital assets. Considering the expertise needed to safely store cryptocurrencies most investors will be able to sleep better with custody service from a professional institution. Diverse : investors can get exposure to the entire cryptocurrency market and not just individual assets. Investing in a basket of cryptocurrencies is suitable for an investor whom is unsure of which cryptocurrencies will emerge as winners but has a positive outlook on the underlying technology. In addition to being simple, secure and diverse, the certificate enjoy a low taxation rate and the index is compliant with the new EU benchmarks regulation. Taxation and compliance is described in the two sections that follow. Taxed lower or Lower taxes or Taxation According to the Swedish Tax Authority (Skatteverket) it is required to contribute capital gains tax on every single cryptocurrency trade. 4 It does not matter if the seller of a cryptocurrency recieve another cryptocurrency or a fiat currency like U.S. dollars, as both crypto-to-fiat and crypto-to-crypto trades are taxable events. This rule alone makes it impossible to for an individual investor to follow a monthly rebalanced top 10 index himself, as there will be hundreds of taxable events to keep track of. In addition to being time-consuming, the tax rules make crypto trading very costly, since the capital gains tax is 30%. There is, however, one exception to the tax rule. Companies that are specialized in buying and selling cryptocurrencies are not taxed on every single trade. Thanks to this exemption, firms like Vinter Capital will not be taxed on every single trade. This rule is extremely beneficial to us and our customers. Even if an individual investor could follow a passive strategy himself, our certificate would still be more attractive due to taxation. In Sweden, an owner of the Blockchain10 certificate can choose to place the certificate in either (a) an account in which the capital gains tax is taken out when they sell the certificate, or (b) an account called \"Investeringssparkonto\" (ISK) in which they pay a fixed percentage on the assets under management (AUM) and currently that fixed percentage is less than 0.5%. Mathematically, the tax for these two choices are (a) AUM * return * 30% , 3 or (b) AUM * 1.49% * 30% . 5 For returns above 1.49% the latter alternative results in a lower tax, and both alternatives are much better than a 30% capital gains tax on every single trade. Hence, the tax rules makes the Blockchain10 certificate attractive to many investors. Compliant/Compliace ((with EU benchmarks regulation)) or Compliance Today, many asset managers (e.g. banks) act as both index provider and asset manager. With the introduction of the EU benchmarks regulation, however, the two entities must be separated. Several banks have reacted by selling their index business to other entites, for example Barcalys sale to X and bankB sale to Y. The separation between index provider and asset manager is important, as it reduces conflict of interest between the asset manager and its customers. Asset managers are obliged to use benchmarks from those index providers that are compliant. It is the asset manager's obligation to ensure the benchmarks and indices they utilize come from a registered benchmark administrator. Furthermore, the regulation forces an asset manager to break the contracts it currently has with its customers. To be comliant, these contracts should be terminated. Upon termination the existing financial product vanishes. As a consequence, the asset manager will have to find a new index to build new financial products upon, and then sell this new instrument to their customers. The regulation is fully applicable as of January 2018, and benchmarks created before 2016 must be compliant in January 2020. Non-compliant asset managers stand to lose significant asset under management and upset their customers. In order to be compliant, asset managers will have to strike deals with index providers. These four factors -- separation, obligation, contract termination and urgency -- all arise from the new benchmarks regulation. It will increase demand for index providers. All index providers will be an integral part of the asset managers financial products. Vinter Capital want to become the Europe's first regulated index provider of cryptocurrency indices. We will create indices for single cryptocurrencies as well as a market index suited for the passive investor. When the indices are launched, there should be plenty of asset managers with a lot of asset under management willing to talk with us. Even single asset trackers, like XBT Provider's bitcoin certificate, need an index since the BTC price is calculated as the average BTC price on three selected exchanges. It is a very simple index, still, the asset manager will need a seperate entity providing the index values. Blockchain10 effects on the market Besides benefitting our customers, the products we create can have an impact on the market as a whole. We predict our product will increase the amount of capital invested to cryptocurrencies, and so will the trading volume on traditional exchanges. Earlier we described the difficulty in buying and safely storing digital assets. These technological barriers exclude many investors from participating in the crypto market. Our exchange traded product lowers the barriers to trade, which allows for more investors and thereby more capital to enter the market. Besides increasing the amount of invested capital, we predict our products will increase the trading volume on traditional exchanges. This provides an incentive for NASDAQ and its competitors to list our certificate. The buyers of the Blockchain10 certificate can be split into two separate groups: those who already own cryptocurrencies and those who currently do not. We can call them \"new\" and \"old\" investors. New investors will contribute to an increase in the total crypto trading volume when they enter the market. Old investors will contribute to shifting trading volume from crypto exchanges to traditional exchanges, for example from Coinbase to NASDAQ. These distrinct groups -- the new and old investors -- are interested in the Blockchain10 certificate for different reasons. New investors are currently sidelined due to the technical difficulties in buying the digital assets. Old investors, on the other hand, benefit from the automatic rebalancing and lower taxes. Nonetheless, from the point of view from the traditional financial exchanges both these groups bring in new revenue to the exchanges. Competition Coinbase is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Thanks to beautiful design and a user friendly interface their product is a simple point of entry for new investors. They are frequently in dialiogue with U.S. regulators and Coinbase have emphasized how important compliance is to them. They have also expressed positive views on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase is using its size to expand into new areas that might be profitable in the future. One such area is custody. Coinbase is not operating in Europe since they focus on being a U.S. complaint crypto exchange. We deem it unlikely that they will expand into Europe, and even more unlikely they will offer a market index fund. If they were to launch an index fund it is more probable the fund would contain only the cryptocurrencies they have listed on their exchange, making the product more of a Coinbase index rather than a market index. Given this, Coinbase is probably not a direct competitor to Vinter Capital, but rather a competitor to the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and other traditional exchanges. XBT Provider issues exchange traded notes tracking the price of BTC and ETH. Total asset under management is USD 700 million, as of September 2018. XBT Provider launched their first bitcoin tracker in Sweden during 2015. In 2017 they issued an exchange traded note (ETN) tracking the price of ether. The BTC and ETH certificates are denominated in both SEK and EUR, giving rise to four certificates, and the BTC tracker denominated in SEK is the most popular one. Their parent company is CoinShares. Based in London they have already added new areas of business such as a crypto hedge fund. [todo sid more?] XBT provider plans to issue more certificates tracking individual cryptocurrencies like XRP, LTC, todo add all. They also plan to release an exchange traded note containing a basket of five cryptocurrencies. It will be weighted by market capitalization. The index members will be decided on before issuing the ETN. Grayscale has a few private cryptocurrency funds for U.S. accredited investors. Grayscale have 8 different funds that tracks the price of a single cryptocurrency: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, ETC, ZEC and ZEN. The bitcoin fund was started in Sep 2013 and all the other funds in 2017 and 2018. At the year end of 2018 Grayscale's assets under management was USD 825 million. With their current fees this implies yearly reveneus of approximately USD 17 million. 6 In addition to the funds tracking single assets, Grayscale have launched the \"Digital Large Cap Fund\", a market capitalization weighted fund containing five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH and LTC. It was launched in Feb 2018 with a yearly fee of 3%. The major difference between our Blockchain10 index and Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund and XBT provider's planned basket, is that the Blockchain10 index is truly passive and responds to changes in the market. Our index contituents change as the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies change. In January 2019 the fifth largest cryptocurrency was EOS, nevertheless Grayscale's large cap fund keeps holding on to the same assets as before, because the constituents are fixed. Blockchain10 is flexible and reflects whatever the market values the most. Bitwise has a private cryptocurrency index fund called BITX. Founded 2017 in San Francisco, the fund has assets under management of USD 200 million as of September 2018. The fee is 2.5% per annum. It is possible to enter and exit the fund weekly, but exiting within one year of entering costs 3% extra i.e. a soft lockup. The minimum amount to invest is USD 250,000. If an investor allocates 1% of her portfolio to the BITX fund, her entire portfolio must be worth USD 25 million. This attracts ultra high net worth individuals. Hence Bitwise lowers the technical bar needed to invest, but raises the financial bar. Arguably, most potential investors are still excluded from the market due to the high financial bar. The Bitwise management know this, and they plan to launch an exchange traded fund (ETF) so that their crypto index fund can be bought and sold by anyone with a brokerage account. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected all application for a Bitcoin ETF, due to concerns around liqudity, security, valuation and custody. These reasons holds true for Bitwise's ETF as well. Bitwise's BITX fund tracks the top 10 cryptocurrencies, weighted by market capitalization. The BITX index is very similar to our BL10 index. A major difference is how circulating supply is calculated. Since market capitalization is given by the price times circulating supply, the choices around how to calculate circulating supply can make a difference on the index value. Bitwise take the current circulating supply and add the supply inflation during the coming five years, before multiplying with price. Vinter Capital, by contrast, simply take the circulating supply times the price. Their formula is Market cap = Price * (Circulating supply + supply inflation coming 5 years) whereas our formula is Market cap = Price * Circulating supply . What the BITX index assumes is that the coming five years of inflation is known to everyone in the market, and already discounted for in the prices. The negative consequence arising from this choice is that Bitwise's index does not follow the market, so it is not suited for passive investing. One effect of including the coming 5 years supply inflation is that the cryptocurrency DASH, which has a high inflation rate, is included in Bitwise's index even though DASH is outside the top 10. << todo schedule a call with grayscale? weekly liq also?

Table: A boring table comparing static info. might be added to the larger table and it might not. probably only the AUM row. Vinter Capital , our firm, is the only company that will provide exposure to a market index trading on exchange. Our Blockchain10 index is designed with the passive investor in mind. The index is tracking the returns of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Moreover, the Blockchain10 certificate will be traded on traditional exchanges, giving investors daily liqudity and a very low minimum investment size. Being able to buy and sell an asset throughout the day is of great importance for all investors in any market -- hence the famous liquidity premium. It is of particular interest to investors who want to keep their portfolio's allocation to cryptocurrencies at a fixed percentage e.g. 5% as it is impossible to do so without daily liqudity. The Blockchain10 certificate lowers the financial bar required to invest, something that cannot be said of Bitwise and Grayscale. Their funds are only available to U.S. accredited investors and require large investments most people cannot afford. The competiton can be summarized as follows. Coinbase is a fiat to crypto exchange, with some additional business legs including custody. Grayscale has several private funds for U.S. accredited investors, and most of their AUM in placed in the bitcoin fund. Bitwise has a private index fund available only for the few who can afford a USD 25,000 investment. XBT Provider is an issuer of exchange traded notes on single cryptocurrencies. Neither Grayscale nor Bitwise offer daily liquidity since their funds are private. The exchange traded notes by XBT provider can be bought and sold intra-day, but they only provide exposure to single assets. Vinter Capital brings the best of both worlds: exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies with public liquidity. To most of our competitors indexing is merely an experimental part -- a secondary business leg. This fact has negative consequences for the quality of their index: Grayscale's index include a five fixed coins, and XBT is planning to create an index containing five fixed coins based on what exchange traded notes they have already issued. This makes the basket ill-suited for passive investing. The competition is engineering their secondary leg to fit into their existing primary business. Our product, by contrast, is engineered to be the perfect solution for tracking the market returns. This focus allow us to make better design choices that inevitably leads to a more suitable index. With that said, there are major similarities between Vinter Capital and its competitors. In essence, we all provide a layer between the underlying cryptocurrencies and the investor. This layer simplifies the way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. About Vinter Capital Road map short like the slide. maybe emphasize first index then cert. Maybe the steps are like this?

To register an account and fulfill the KYC requirements, a user must send copies of gas bills, photos of passport and sometimes download a video conferencing app to have a video call with the on-boarding team. Waiting times are long -- often several days. Patience is a virtue, and the registration process is a real test of patience. Different exchanges have different user interfaces. This can make order placing confusing when the customer is used to a certain interface and suddenly the order book is visualized a different way, or the buy button is on the left instead of on the right. Obviously this slows down the speed at which trades can be executed and increases the risk for human errors. Different exchanges also have different trading rules on order size, leverage, maker and taker fees etc. Moreover, the same virtual currency can have different names on different exchanges -- bitcoin can for example have the ticker BTC or XBT. Differences between exchanges increase the risk for manual errors. For many investors, registering at a single exchange is insufficient due to: asset coverage, technical reliability, liquidity and pricing. All four reasons are discussed below. Asset coverage is a problem for an investor who want to trade the top 10 cryptocurrencies because all them might not be listed -- Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges but has not listed the top 10 assets. Technical reliability and up-time has been a problem for many exchanges, especially during periods when many want to trade or open up new accounts such as during the boom of 2017. During this boom, when many new investors wanted to register to buy and some old investors wanted to sell, even the largest exchanges like Kraken and Binance experienced severe problems. Kraken was down so people who really wanted to trade could not. Binance stopped taking on more customers. For times like these investors who have registered at many exchanges have a much higher probability of being able to execute trades. Liquidity is the third reason to register at several exchanges. When buying large amounts of crypto or buying small cap cryptocurrencies, the order book might not be deep enough. In these cases it is beneficial to spread out the trade on several exchanges. Pricing is the last and most obvious reason: sometimes the price on one exchange is more favorable than another. << todo sid provide source that most people bought 1-3 different ones. i say that in part ii also.","title":"Difficult to buy"},{"location":"texts/3part3/#difficult-to-store","text":"Traditional financial instruments, like stocks and bonds, are stored at a central securities deposit or custodian such as Euroclear. When buying these assets the investor can enjoy the storage solution his bank provides, giving him piece of mind. Cryptocurrencies, in contrast, are stored by the owner. This is a common source of headache for cryptocurrency investors. Storage is important and complicated. To quantify the importance of storage is easy because losing the password implies a return of minus 100 percent. To quantify how complicated it is to store the digital assets safely, consider that USD 670 million worth of cryptocurrencies were lost in the first quarter of 2018 due to bad storage or theft. 1 When the previous exchange Mt. Gox was hacked, 850 thousand bitcoins were stolen. Assuming a BTCUSD price of 6000 this hack was worth USD 5.1 billion. Apart from protecting against thieves, all cryptocurrency users must be protected against themselves. Even though users are heavily incentivized to store their digital wealth with care, stories of lost coins are plentiful. One common way is to forget the password. Another is to throw away the laptop when the coins were not worth that much just to realize a year later they threw away thousands of dollars. 2 History provides a clear conclusion: users are not skilled at storing their own digital wealth. Safely storing the digital assets is hard partly because the technology is in its infancy. Anyone who has bought and safely stored cryptocurrencies know this. Further, the human brain is trained to hide physical objects but not digital information. This fact about our human nature make digital security unintuitive. The storage complications provide a good reason for investors to stay away from the crypto market. Institutional investors cannot afford to buy an asset when the risk of loosing it so high. The technical knowledge needed to safely store coins takes time to acquire, and investors with deep pockets have a high opportunity cost. Portfolio managers that are asked why they have not bought cryptocurrencies often state volatility as a primary reason, but storage is in fact a much larger problem (especially since higher volatility is accompanied with higher returns).","title":"Difficult to store"},{"location":"texts/3part3/#busy-passive-investing-or-acitiviesactivity-for-a-passive-investor","text":"Assume an investor, whom we can call David, is both bullish on the crypto market and believe in a passive investment strategy.

Upon termination the existing financial product vanishes. As a consequence, the asset manager will have to find a new index to build new financial products upon, and then sell this new instrument to their customers. The regulation is fully applicable as of January 2018, and benchmarks created before 2016 must be compliant in January 2020. Non-compliant asset managers stand to lose significant asset under management and upset their customers. In order to be compliant, asset managers will have to strike deals with index providers. These four factors -- separation, obligation, contract termination and urgency -- all arise from the new benchmarks regulation. It will increase demand for index providers. All index providers will be an integral part of the asset managers financial products. Vinter Capital want to become the Europe's first regulated index provider of cryptocurrency indices. We will create indices for single cryptocurrencies as well as a market index suited for the passive investor. When the indices are launched, there should be plenty of asset managers with a lot of asset under management willing to talk with us. Even single asset trackers, like XBT Provider's bitcoin certificate, need an index since the BTC price is calculated as the average BTC price on three selected exchanges. It is a very simple index, still, the asset manager will need a seperate entity providing the index values.","title":"Compliant/Compliace ((with EU benchmarks regulation)) or Compliance"},{"location":"texts/3part3/#blockchain10-effects-on-the-market","text":"Besides benefitting our customers, the products we create can have an impact on the market as a whole. We predict our product will increase the amount of capital invested to cryptocurrencies, and so will the trading volume on traditional exchanges. Earlier we described the difficulty in buying and safely storing digital assets. These technological barriers exclude many investors from participating in the crypto market. Our exchange traded product lowers the barriers to trade, which allows for more investors and thereby more capital to enter the market. Besides increasing the amount of invested capital, we predict our products will increase the trading volume on traditional exchanges. This provides an incentive for NASDAQ and its competitors to list our certificate. The buyers of the Blockchain10 certificate can be split into two separate groups: those who already own cryptocurrencies and those who currently do not. We can call them \"new\" and \"old\" investors. New investors will contribute to an increase in the total crypto trading volume when they enter the market. Old investors will contribute to shifting trading volume from crypto exchanges to traditional exchanges, for example from Coinbase to NASDAQ. These distrinct groups -- the new and old investors -- are interested in the Blockchain10 certificate for different reasons. New investors are currently sidelined due to the technical difficulties in buying the digital assets. Old investors, on the other hand, benefit from the automatic rebalancing and lower taxes. Nonetheless, from the point of view from the traditional financial exchanges both these groups bring in new revenue to the exchanges.","title":"Blockchain10 effects on the market"},{"location":"texts/3part3/#competition","text":"Coinbase is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Thanks to beautiful design and a user friendly interface their product is a simple point of entry for new investors. They are frequently in dialiogue with U.S. regulators and Coinbase have emphasized how important compliance is to them. They have also expressed positive views on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase is using its size to expand into new areas that might be profitable in the future. One such area is custody. Coinbase is not operating in Europe since they focus on being a U.S. complaint crypto exchange. We deem it unlikely that they will expand into Europe, and even more unlikely they will offer a market index fund. If they were to launch an index fund it is more probable the fund would contain only the cryptocurrencies they have listed on their exchange, making the product more of a Coinbase index rather than a market index. Given this, Coinbase is probably not a direct competitor to Vinter Capital, but rather a competitor to the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and other traditional exchanges. XBT Provider issues exchange traded notes tracking the price of BTC and ETH. Total asset under management is USD 700 million, as of September 2018. XBT Provider launched their first bitcoin tracker in Sweden during 2015. In 2017 they issued an exchange traded note (ETN) tracking the price of ether. The BTC and ETH certificates are denominated in both SEK and EUR, giving rise to four certificates, and the BTC tracker denominated in SEK is the most popular one. Their parent company is CoinShares. Based in London they have already added new areas of business such as a crypto hedge fund. [todo sid more?] XBT provider plans to issue more certificates tracking individual cryptocurrencies like XRP, LTC, todo add all. They also plan to release an exchange traded note containing a basket of five cryptocurrencies. It will be weighted by market capitalization. The index members will be decided on before issuing the ETN. Grayscale has a few private cryptocurrency funds for U.S. accredited investors. Grayscale have 8 different funds that tracks the price of a single cryptocurrency: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, ETC, ZEC and ZEN. The bitcoin fund was started in Sep 2013 and all the other funds in 2017 and 2018. At the year end of 2018 Grayscale's assets under management was USD 825 million. With their current fees this implies yearly reveneus of approximately USD 17 million. 6 In addition to the funds tracking single assets, Grayscale have launched the \"Digital Large Cap Fund\", a market capitalization weighted fund containing five cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH and LTC. It was launched in Feb 2018 with a yearly fee of 3%. The major difference between our Blockchain10 index and Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund and XBT provider's planned basket, is that the Blockchain10 index is truly passive and responds to changes in the market. Our index contituents change as the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies change. In January 2019 the fifth largest cryptocurrency was EOS, nevertheless Grayscale's large cap fund keeps holding on to the same assets as before, because the constituents are fixed. Blockchain10 is flexible and reflects whatever the market values the most. Bitwise has a private cryptocurrency index fund called BITX. Founded 2017 in San Francisco, the fund has assets under management of USD 200 million as of September 2018. The fee is 2.5% per annum. It is possible to enter and exit the fund weekly, but exiting within one year of entering costs 3% extra i.e. a soft lockup. The minimum amount to invest is USD 250,000. If an investor allocates 1% of her portfolio to the BITX fund, her entire portfolio must be worth USD 25 million. This attracts ultra high net worth individuals. Hence Bitwise lowers the technical bar needed to invest, but raises the financial bar. Arguably, most potential investors are still excluded from the market due to the high financial bar. The Bitwise management know this, and they plan to launch an exchange traded fund (ETF) so that their crypto index fund can be bought and sold by anyone with a brokerage account. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected all application for a Bitcoin ETF, due to concerns around liqudity, security, valuation and custody. These reasons holds true for Bitwise's ETF as well. Bitwise's BITX fund tracks the top 10 cryptocurrencies, weighted by market capitalization. The BITX index is very similar to our BL10 index. A major difference is how circulating supply is calculated. Since market capitalization is given by the price times circulating supply, the choices around how to calculate circulating supply can make a difference on the index value. Bitwise take the current circulating supply and add the supply inflation during the coming five years, before multiplying with price. Vinter Capital, by contrast, simply take the circulating supply times the price. Their formula is Market cap = Price * (Circulating supply + supply inflation coming 5 years) whereas our formula is Market cap = Price * Circulating supply . What the BITX index assumes is that the coming five years of inflation is known to everyone in the market, and already discounted for in the prices. The negative consequence arising from this choice is that Bitwise's index does not follow the market, so it is not suited for passive investing. One effect of including the coming 5 years supply inflation is that the cryptocurrency DASH, which has a high inflation rate, is included in Bitwise's index even though DASH is outside the top 10. << todo schedule a call with grayscale? weekly liq also?

Table: A boring table comparing static info. might be added to the larger table and it might not. probably only the AUM row. Vinter Capital , our firm, is the only company that will provide exposure to a market index trading on exchange. Our Blockchain10 index is designed with the passive investor in mind. The index is tracking the returns of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Moreover, the Blockchain10 certificate will be traded on traditional exchanges, giving investors daily liqudity and a very low minimum investment size. Being able to buy and sell an asset throughout the day is of great importance for all investors in any market -- hence the famous liquidity premium. It is of particular interest to investors who want to keep their portfolio's allocation to cryptocurrencies at a fixed percentage e.g. 5% as it is impossible to do so without daily liqudity. The Blockchain10 certificate lowers the financial bar required to invest, something that cannot be said of Bitwise and Grayscale. Their funds are only available to U.S. accredited investors and require large investments most people cannot afford. The competiton can be summarized as follows. Coinbase is a fiat to crypto exchange, with some additional business legs including custody. Grayscale has several private funds for U.S. accredited investors, and most of their AUM in placed in the bitcoin fund. Bitwise has a private index fund available only for the few who can afford a USD 25,000 investment. XBT Provider is an issuer of exchange traded notes on single cryptocurrencies. Neither Grayscale nor Bitwise offer daily liquidity since their funds are private. The exchange traded notes by XBT provider can be bought and sold intra-day, but they only provide exposure to single assets. Vinter Capital brings the best of both worlds: exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies with public liquidity. To most of our competitors indexing is merely an experimental part -- a secondary business leg. This fact has negative consequences for the quality of their index: Grayscale's index include a five fixed coins, and XBT is planning to create an index containing five fixed coins based on what exchange traded notes they have already issued. This makes the basket ill-suited for passive investing. The competition is engineering their secondary leg to fit into their existing primary business. Our product, by contrast, is engineered to be the perfect solution for tracking the market returns. This focus allow us to make better design choices that inevitably leads to a more suitable index. With that said, there are major similarities between Vinter Capital and its competitors. In essence, we all provide a layer between the underlying cryptocurrencies and the investor. This layer simplifies the way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.","title":"Competition"},{"location":"texts/3part3/#about-vinter-capital","text":"","title":"About Vinter Capital"},{"location":"texts/3part3/#road-map","text":"short like the slide. maybe emphasize first index then cert.

Bandwidth portfolio In the section [Including cryptocurrency to a traditional portfolio] we showed the historical returns for a portoflio with 5% allocation to the Blockchain10 certificate and 95% allocation to a traditional 60/40 stocks/bonds portfolio. In practice, it is almost impossible to keep exactly 60% allocated to stocks and 40% to bonds in the traditional portfolio TRD. From day to day, price fluctuations alters the relative weights. This is even more true for the balanced portfolio BAL since it contain volatile cryptocurrencies. Whenever the largest cryptocurrencies increase in value so does the portfolio's allocation to BL10, and vice versa. For this reason it is more realistic to use allocation intervals rather than exact percentages. This allocation strategy is often refered to as \"bandwidth\" rebalancing since we set an initial weight to for example 60% but then allow the weight to vary between 55% and 65%. Let us carry out a similar analysis as with TRD and BAL, but with their more realistic bandwidth versions TRDB and BALB. Here, TRDB is a traditional portfolio with initial weights of 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds, and TRDB is rebalanced to its initial weights whenever the weight in stocks go above 65% or below 55%. Similarly, BALB is a balanced portfolio with initial weight of 95% in TRDB and 5% in BL10, and BALB is rebalanced back to its initial weights whenever weight in BL10 go above 7% or below 3%. Conclusions from the simpler example with BAL witll holds...

Sometimes there are actions a coin owner can take that will almost surely be profitable. Examples of such events are air-drops, staking and hard forks. We can call them chain events and they share some characterics with events that occur for traditional stocks. Chain event Stock event Air-drops Dividends Staking Stock lending Hard fork De-merger Table: Chain events resemble stock event. Air-drops resembles stock dividends. No company needs to pay out dividends, but some choose to - for a variety of reasons. Likewise, no cryptocurrency project needs to air drop, but some chose to. In an air-drop, every holder of that currency recieves some amount of coins \"for free\". Many cryptocurrencies are led teams who want to market their project and increase the price of their cryptocurrency. To attract buyers, or reward the current owners of their currency, a project might initiate an air-drop. In order to get the \"free\" coins, actions are required from the coin holder. An example of such an action can be transferring his coins to a wallet before a due date. Thus, air-drops are not free coins, but rather an event in which investors can trade their time for some reward. Whether that trade is worthwhile depends on a combination of factors such as the investors tehcincal skills, how much he has invested as well as how much coins is payed out in the air-drop. A key difference between air-drops and stock dividends are that dividens are payed out automatically without the stock owner having to take much action, whereas a coin holder must follow the news to know that an air-drop is taking place and then take the required actions to capitalize on it. Staking resembles stock lending. When staking a coin, the owner puts an amount of the cryptocurrency in a certain place (e.g. a wallet) for which he earns some reward (e.g. a 1% interest on the coins in that wallet). Only some cryptocurrencies allow staking. The Ethereum community is considering adding a way to stake ETH. 1 Some coins that do support staking are EOS, Stellar, Cardano, and DASH. In order to stake DASH, the user must own send coins to a wallet that locks them up for a year, and the minimum amount to send is 1000 coins - which is currenthly worth USD 200k. The reward for staking DASH is [todo sid insert]. All coins have different ways of staking - the way to stake DASH differs from Cardano - so to stake multiple coins a user must be knowledable and up to date. The interest earned on staking cannot be considered free money since it requires work and involves some risk of loosing the coins. Staking is a worthwshile acticity if the reward is attractive enough relative to the risk, and only a minority of users stake their coins. 2 A difference between stock lending and staking is the purpose for doing it. Stock lending is primarly done to short sell. Staking, on the other hand, can be done for different reasons e.g. DASH stakers can gain political power and secure the network (in a way similar to bitcoin miners). Hard forks resembles company de-mergers. When a firm de-mergers, it becomes two separate companies. A famous de-merger is when British Telecom spun off its mobile phone business \"BT Wireless\". Likewise, when a blockchain hard forks, it splits into two separate chains. The most famous one is when Bitcoin forked from BTC to BTC and BCH. Another famous example is when Ethereum forked into ETC and ETH, because the community had different opinions of whether the Dao hack should be reversed or not (the ETH chain wanted it reversed but the ETC chain did not). When a company de-mergers, the two individual stocks will have different prices and they will sum to either more or less than when they were one entity - the de merger can be said to either increase or decrease the \"shareholder value\". The same is true for blockchains. In the case of the Bitcoin hard fork, the total value of both coins after the work was higher than before. Everyone who held Bitcoin before the fork was granted equally many BCH as they had in BTC, so that a user who owned BTC 2.44 before the fork had a total of 2.44 BTC + 2.44 BCH after the fork. Due to how the prices evolved, users were better off before the fork than after - one could say that the fork increased \"coin holder value\". In future hard forks the prices of the coins after the fork has occured is inknown, so the coin holder value might increase or decrease. Still, in both cases the owner will need to take some actions. After the bitcoin fork happened, every user who wanted to claim their BCH had to perform a series of techincall steps (including importing the BTC private key into a BCH compatible wallet). Even today, many early adopters of bitcoin have not got ahold of their BCH, and since those coins are of monetary value the logical conclusion must be that these users lack the technical skills needed to capitalize on the fork. Many of these users can be considered early adopters - nevertheless they would have had higher returns by investing in a fund that posessed the ability to capitalize on the fork. In the future there might be other types of chain events that does not exists today. Cryptocurrencies are yet in their infancy, so change is to be expected. All of the mentioned chain events (air-drops, staking and forks) have occured due the communities' choices, and the open source nature of cryptocurrencies makes is likely that new ideas spread and gets implemented. The possible innovation and technolical progress is one reason why virtual currencies is an exciting sphere to be in. \"Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance.\" Matthew 13:12 Economies of scale clearly exists in chain events. Vinter capital will utilize its cryptocurrency experts to capitalize on air-drops, staking and forks whenever it is advantagous to do so. Of course it is not guaranteed that these actions will be profitable, or that our firm will be able to do better than a single individual, but it is likely that a professional actor enjoys several advantages over individual users. Two such advantages are more time and capital: A fund can devote more time to the research, and pool capital from many investors in order to make the tradeoff between risk and reward worthwhile. ((Moreover, Vinter Capital is incentivized to act in the best interest of their customers, since a bad performance might lead to lower asset under management.)) financial and statistical analysis see graph-gallery.pdf available on the github repo finplot . table on risk and return sortino, sharpe, etc. promised it in the section case for cyrpto. myths arguments against cryptocurrencies volatile \"it is volatile\". yes. here is how volatile it is compared to other asset classes. On a side note it\u2019s worth to mention that the large part of the vol. is attributed mainly from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies huge price surge, not capturing downside risk. bubble \"it might be a bubble\". yes we know. it is early stage. it is uncertain. our downside is capped (a fixed amount of time and money will be spent). but the upside is unlimited (if blockchains revolutionize one industry the ROI will be ridiliously high). 3 that's you should make a small bet early, with small portoflio weights. illegal activity Bitcoin is linked with Silk Road, where the purchase of illegal drugs was possible. This gives Bitcoin a bad reputation that it does not deserve. Criminals have use and will always use technology when performing illegal activities. The technology they use can be cars, cell phones, cash, bitcoin, etc. We rarely blaim the US dollar or post offices which both facilitate high volume of illegal trades, e.g. guns bought with cash. ((The same logic should apply to other currencies.)) Researchers estimate todo percent of all bitcoin transactions come from illegal activity, 4 whereas todo percent of all Cash in USD cash transactions come from illegal acticity. 5 more sections todo: read https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths and include some of these, such as - 1 - 2 - 7 - 17 - 33 but try to make it less bitcoin focues and more crypto focues, if possible. no intrisic value above we noted that a blockchain digitize trust, and can be used to replace current intermediaries, so from this use case it has value. moreover, it also has value because it's a network in which value can be transfered - the internet is a network where information can be sent. Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Bitcoin_has_no_intrinsic_value_.28unlike_some_other_things.29 it does not work today bitcoin has never been hacked, you can send and recieve transactions instantly world-wide (and they settle in 10 min not T+2). there are problem on how hard it is to use and that only a few take it as means of payment. progress is being made, but it's not done yet. and it is ok that it not every little detail is solved yet. this was the case both with cars and electricity. 6 todo sid insert source. \u21a9 todo sid insert source that it is less than 50% of users. \u21a9 it might be a bubble that pops (goes to zero). it might be the beginning of a tech that explodes and disrupts finance, insurande, and other industries (goes to infinity). employees and investors in axlantic hold a call option. so we love this volatility / risk / uncertainty since the value of a call option increases with volatility. the same idea expressed in a more theoreical way: a call option increases in value when the volatility (uncertainty) is high. investing time and money in this company can be considered as an option on the cryptocurrency market. all employees and investors in this company all hold an option, and one reason this option is valuable is precisely because of the volatility - uncertainty - of whether this technology a bubble about to burst or if it is a techn that will disrupt. \u21a9 todo find this. \u21a9 todo google and insert a trust worthy source. \u21a9 andreas antonop has a good chapter about infrastructure inversion in his non tech book. at first they say \"it is so slow, it cant work, look\" because the car tries to work in the current infrastructure of kullersten and horses hit. when you build roads for cars, both the horse and the car can go on that road, however, the car flourishes. that is an example of infrastructure inversion. another example is using electricity in your home. in the beginning it was only right people and nuts who had it. your house could be burnt down, etc. because the infrastructure was gas pipes... same principle as in the car-horse-example. \u21a9","title":"Appendix"},{"location":"texts/4appendix/#appendix-","text":"","title":"Appendix {-}"},{"location":"texts/4appendix/#time-period-used","text":"Unless otherwise specified, the time period we use for graphs and calculations are 2015-11 to 2018-11.

Vinter capital will utilize its cryptocurrency experts to capitalize on air-drops, staking and forks whenever it is advantagous to do so. Of course it is not guaranteed that these actions will be profitable, or that our firm will be able to do better than a single individual, but it is likely that a professional actor enjoys several advantages over individual users. Two such advantages are more time and capital: A fund can devote more time to the research, and pool capital from many investors in order to make the tradeoff between risk and reward worthwhile. ((Moreover, Vinter Capital is incentivized to act in the best interest of their customers, since a bad performance might lead to lower asset under management.))","title":"Chain events and economies of scale"},{"location":"texts/4appendix/#financial-and-statistical-analysis","text":"see graph-gallery.pdf available on the github repo finplot .","title":"financial and statistical analysis"},{"location":"texts/4appendix/#table-on-risk-and-return","text":"sortino, sharpe, etc. promised it in the section case for cyrpto.","title":"table on risk and return"},{"location":"texts/4appendix/#myths-arguments-against-cryptocurrencies","text":"","title":"myths  arguments against cryptocurrencies"},{"location":"texts/4appendix/#volatile","text":"\"it is volatile\". yes. here is how volatile it is compared to other asset classes.

Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Bitcoin_has_no_intrinsic_value_.28unlike_some_other_things.29","title":"no intrisic value"},{"location":"texts/4appendix/#it-does-not-work-today","text":"bitcoin has never been hacked, you can send and recieve transactions instantly world-wide (and they settle in 10 min not T+2). there are problem on how hard it is to use and that only a few take it as means of payment. progress is being made, but it's not done yet. and it is ok that it not every little detail is solved yet. this was the case both with cars and electricity. 6 todo sid insert source. \u21a9 todo sid insert source that it is less than 50% of users. \u21a9 it might be a bubble that pops (goes to zero). it might be the beginning of a tech that explodes and disrupts finance, insurande, and other industries (goes to infinity). employees and investors in axlantic hold a call option. so we love this volatility / risk / uncertainty since the value of a call option increases with volatility. the same idea expressed in a more theoreical way: a call option increases in value when the volatility (uncertainty) is high. investing time and money in this company can be considered as an option on the cryptocurrency market. all employees and investors in this company all hold an option, and one reason this option is valuable is precisely because of the volatility - uncertainty - of whether this technology a bubble about to burst or if it is a techn that will disrupt. \u21a9 todo find this. \u21a9 todo google and insert a trust worthy source. \u21a9 andreas antonop has a good chapter about infrastructure inversion in his non tech book. at first they say \"it is so slow, it cant work, look\" because the car tries to work in the current infrastructure of kullersten and horses hit. when you build roads for cars, both the horse and the car can go on that road, however, the car flourishes. that is an example of infrastructure inversion. another example is using electricity in your home. in the beginning it was only right people and nuts who had it. your house could be burnt down, etc. because the infrastructure was gas pipes... same principle as in the car-horse-example. \u21a9","title":"it does not work today"}]}
